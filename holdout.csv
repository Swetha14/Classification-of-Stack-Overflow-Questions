iphone: how to copy a file from resources to documents   i just started with iphone development. in one of the example where i had to display some data stored in sqlite db in a table view in a tabbar controller  i had to move a sqlite file from application bundle to the documents folder.    i used the application template - ios > application > window-based application for iphone (used core data for storage)    in the template generated by xcode (base sdk set to latest ios = 4.2)  the following code was there...   <pre><code>- (nsurl *)applicationdocumentsdirectory {     return [[[nsfilemanager defaultmanager] urlsfordirectory:nsdocumentdirectory indomains:nsuserdomainmask] lastobject]; } </code></pre>   in trying to get a path to documents folder  i used the method given above like this...   <pre><code>nsstring *documentdirectory = [self applicationdocumentsdirectory]; </code></pre>   this gave a warning - <code>warning: incompatible objective-c types initializing  struct nsurl *   expected  struct nsstring * </code>    so i changed the code to following...   <pre><code>// added the message absolutestring over here nsstring *documentdirectory = [[self applicationdocumentsdirectory] absolutestring];  nsstring *writabledbpath = [documentdirectory stringbyappendingpathcomponent:@ mydb.sqlite ]; nsstring *defaultdbpath = [[[nsbundle mainbundle] resourcepath] stringbyappendingpathcomponent:@ mydb.sqlite ]; bool success = [filemanager copyitematpath:defaultdbpath topath:writabledbpath error:&amp;error]; if (!success) {    nslog(@ failed to create writable database file with message  %@ .

why is my object out of scope in viewwilldisappear if i change the object s value   so i have this class:   <pre><code>@interface amountviewcontroller : uitableviewcontroller &lt;uitableviewdelegate  uitextfielddelegate&gt;{  nsmanagedobjectcontext *managedobjectcontext; nsmanagedobject *selectedobject;  nsdecimalnumber *amount; nsdecimalnumber *accountbalance;  nsinteger textfieldrow;  } - (void)textfielddone:(id)sender; - (nsdecimalnumber *)absolutevalue:(nsdecimalnumber *)number;  @property (nonatomic  retain) nsmanagedobjectcontext *managedobjectcontext; @property (nonatomic  retain) nsmanagedobject *selectedobject; @property (nonatomic  retain) nsdecimalnumber *amount; @property (nonatomic  retain) nsdecimalnumber *accountbalance; @property nsinteger textfieldrow;  @end </code></pre>   now in my implementation   <pre><code>- (void)viewwilldisappear:(bool)animated { nslog(@ select object amount value: %@   [selectedobject valueforkey:@ amount ]); if (amount != nil) //amount is out of scope  has something to do with retain  but accountbalance is in scope.     {     nslog(@ textfield amount: %@   amount);     //todo: save changes to amount     //[selectedobject setvalue:amount forkey:@ amount ];      nserror *error = nil;     if (managedobjectcontext != nil) {         if ([managedobjectcontext haschanges] &amp;&amp; ![managedobjectcontext save:&amp;error]) {             nslog(@ unresolved error %@  %@   error  [error userinfo]);             abort();         }      }      nslog(@ select object amount value (after save): %@   [selectedobject valueforkey:@ amount ]); } [super viewwilldisappear:animated]; } </code></pre>   for some reason  the amount object is  out of scope  only if i modify its value before reaching the viewwilldisappear method. so for instance  i load this view and press back  everything is good. but if i change the amount value then press back  the debugger shows that the amount is out of scope. my thinking here is that the object is getting released prior to reaching the viewwilldisappear method  but i m not sure what exactly to do. i tried other variations of (atomic/nonatomoic  retain/assign/copy) but i m not sure i really understand all that even after reading about them. :/     also  the selectedobject  accountbalance and other objects are still in scope even though they have the same property attributes. any help is appreciated. thanks. let me know if i can provide more info for you.,iphone

iphone - how to declare a method and avoid leaks  suppose i have a method like this   <pre><code>- (uibutton *) createbuttonatx:(cgfloat)vx y:(cgfloat)vy{   //... bla bla bla...   //at some point i have   uibutton *mybutton = [[uibutton alloc] initwithframe:myframe];  // we have an alloc here...   // ... more bla bla and then  return mybutton; } </code></pre>   as the button was allocated and not released this is technically a leak  right     on my main code  the caller will be like   <pre><code>uibutton *onebutton = [self createbuttonatx:100 y:100]; [myview addsubview:onebutton]; [onebutton release]; </code></pre>   in theory  onebutton that is mybutton on createbutton method is being released on the main code  but even so  instruments will point the method as leaking...    how to solve that  using autorelease     thanks,iphone

why does animating a subview cause its parent view s layoutsubviews method to be called   i m doing uiview animation on individual subviews that have a number of sibling views that i don t want affected by the single-view animation. however <code>layoutsubviews</code> is being called on the containing superview when i do the animation  causing the other siblings to be rearranged as well.     (i should explain that i m doing initial subview layout in the parent view s <code>layoutsubviews</code> method; i only want it to be called the first time i m setting up the subviews  not when i m animating them individually later on.)    why is the parent view s <code>layoutsubviews</code> method being called when animating its subviews,iphone

no internet connection  i am a little confused on how to go about and do this....    on each page of my app i connect to php file to drag in data from my server. i have about 10 pages. now if there is no connection to the internet then of course now data can be received.    often the app crashes and we are putting this down to not having the data due to a change in connection or wifi whatever.    now i have setup the reachability thing and that works  but i dont know how to link this in with the php calls. should i check the reachability and if no connection then dont run the call. if so  what about all the variables  they will still be null and cause an error then     i dont really know what is the best solution.    hope you can help alex,iphone

can an iphone app call another app   example:   contacts  in iphone does not organize contacts into groups (mailing lists).  you could write an app that maintains a database on the phone itself.  groups could be  co-workers    party friends    relatives  etc.    from another app it would be nice to call up this app.    imagine an app named  tellmyfriends .  this app can summon the photo library to select a photo  or the camera to take a new photo.  (you can do this with the iphone sdk.)    now you want to send the photo to  party friends .  you want to summon the second app that has the database of groups.  select the  party friends  group and it returns with a list of names that the first app can then find in the phone s address book.  can this be done,iphone

making large toolbars like the ipod app  i am trying to create a toolbar programatically (rather than via ib) very similar to the toolbar featured in the iphone app:    <img src= https://i.stack.imgur.com/t165y.png  alt= enter image description here >    currently i ve been experimenting with the <code>uitoolbar</code> class  but i m not sure how (and if ) you can make the toolbar buttons centrally aligned and large like that in the ipod app.    additionally  regardless of size  the gradient/reflection artwork never correctly respects the size and is stuck as if the object is the default smaller size.    if this cannot be done with a standard <code>uitoolbar</code>  i guess i need to create my own view. in this case  can the reflection/gradient be created programmatically or will it require some clever alpha tranparency photoshopped artwork,iphone

sql server runs sp on startup - where s the magic   we have several <strong>sql server 2008 r2</strong> environments <strong>(dev  qa  production)</strong> with databases for an <strong>asp.net</strong> application.      this applicaton uses <strong>asp.net membership</strong> and <strong>sql server session providers</strong>  thus we have an <strong>aspstate database</strong>.      the functionality of these providers were extended to restrict one active session per login.  our implementation added tables to <strong>tempdb</strong>  a stored <code>proc aspstate.dbo.createtemptables</code> to create these tables  and another stored <code>proc master.dbo.aspstate_startup</code> which calls the <strong>sp</strong> in <strong>aspstate</strong>.    on my dev machine and in production  when <strong>sql server</strong> is started <code>master.dbo.aspstate_startup</code> is executed and the tables are created.      i am setting up a new <strong>qa environment</strong> and cannot figure out how that happens (so in <strong>qa</strong>  the tables are not added to <strong>tempdb</strong> on <strong>startup</strong>).  i have compared schema and permissions manually and via <strong>red gate s compare tool</strong> and find no differences there.      i checked the jobs and none call either of these stored procs.      any ideas of where the magic is hiding     thanks  scott,sql

efficient & compatible way to call several functions on a single  complex sql result   i m developing a <a href= https://github.com/brick/geo  rel= nofollow >geometry library</a> that <a href= https://github.com/brick/geo/blob/master/src/engine/databaseengine.php  rel= nofollow >delegates complex calculations to a gis-enabled database</a> such as postgresql with postgis  sqlite with spatialite  or newer versions of mysql.    when communicating with the database  i need so send back and forth:   <ul> <li>a textual or binary representation of the geometry</li> <li>its srid (spatial reference system identifier)  an integer that is commonly associated to a geometry but is not part of its textual representation</li> </ul>   sending a geometry to the database is an easy one-step process:   <pre class= lang-sql prettyprint-override ><code>st_geomfromtext(text  srid) </code></pre>   but retrieving the geometry is a two-step process:   <ul> <li><code>st_astext(geom)</code></li> <li><code>st_srid(geom)</code></li> </ul>   now let s take a real-life example.    here is the sql i m sending to get the centroid of a polygon:   <pre class= lang-sql prettyprint-override ><code>select st_astext(st_centroid(st_geomfromtext(geom  srid))); </code></pre>   as you can see  i m only getting the textual representation of the geometry back  and am missing the srid.    <strong>how can i efficiently get the result of both <code>st_astext()</code> and <code>st_srid()</code> in a single query </strong>    here are the possibilities i considered so far:   <ul> <li> sending two separate queries:   <pre class= lang-sql prettyprint-override ><code>select st_astext (st_centroid(st_geomfromtext(geom  srid))); select st_srid   (st_centroid(st_geomfromtext(geom  srid))); </code></pre>   this is obviously the less efficient of all  and the one i want to avoid at all costs. </li> <li> sending a single query  but repeating the calculation twice:   <pre class= lang-sql prettyprint-override ><code>select     st_astext (st_centroid(st_geomfromtext(geom  srid)))      st_srid   (st_centroid(st_geomfromtext(geom  srid))); </code></pre>   a bit better  but i m afraid not all databases will be able to optimize this query so that <code>st_centroid()</code> and <code>st_geomfromtext()</code> are only executed once (maybe i m wrong on this point  feel free to argue against this). but anyway  i don t think there is a way around passing the parameters twice to the prepared statement  which is a waste of resources. </li> <li> storing the result in a variable  then calling the two functions on it:   <pre class= lang-sql prettyprint-override ><code>set @geom = st_centroid(st_geomfromtext(geom  srid)); select st_astext(@geom)  st_srid(@geom); </code></pre>   this feels like the best way to me  but as you can see the syntax is vendor-specific (mysql in this example). <strong>is there a standard way to do this </strong> </li> </ul>   note that this must work on mysql  postgresql  sqlite  and maybe other dbms in the future.    feel free to explore other out-of-the-box ideas that i would have missed!    <em>side note: you may wonder why i m not always considering that the result geometry has the same srid as the input geometry; this is probably true  but what happens when a function is called with two geometries with different srid is not defined by the standard afaik  so ideally i d like the library to stay unopinionated on the subject  and just return whatever srid the database returns.</em>,sql

how to structure many and/or complex sql queries   having quite a lot of sql queries  many of them ad-hoc-ones  a database has grown a bit messy.  i have two problems :    <ol> <li>hard to keep many different views/sproc s in good order when only using names to structure them</li> <li>subqueries (views that calls other views  in 2-4 levels) adds to the structure mess and are hard to maintain</li> </ol>   now i like to get a better structure in my database and/or in my c# code (could be java/python/ruby/whatever). how     should i use  schemas  in sql to separate views in different areas  like namespaces.    should i avoid having lot of tsql in the database altoghether and instead keep the querying to my c#  that would move the database logic closer to the rest of the system  and would be much easier to maintain and keep in code versioning  but at the same time i appreciate being close to the data  to keep performance good (with the help of sql profiler).    any other suggestion     update: the database and the c#-projects are a few years old and has grown  and will continue to grow over time (different areas of functionality) + new projects will be added. i need to clean it up in a good way  or change strategy.,sql

bringing back multiple max on a single column in sql  i have a spreadsheet with customer accounts and when we get a new account it gets added on using a reference account number i.e. anderson electrical would be and01 etc. i m trying to use sql to bring back the highest number from each variation of letterings e.g. if and01 already existed and our highest company value was and34 then it would just bring back and34 rather than 1 to 34.    each account has the first 3 letters of there company name followed by whatever the next number is.    hope i have explained this well enouh for someone to understand :),sql
sql select  sometime need  where  +/-  and  sometimes need neither  i have a query to construct sometimes it will be    <strong>strsql =  select * from  tablea </strong>    sometimes it will be    <strong>strsql =  select * from tablea where fielda > x </strong>    sometimes it will be    <strong>strsql =  select * from  tablea where fieldb &lt; y </strong>    and finally sometimes it s    <strong>strsql =  select * from  tablea where fielda > x and fieldb &lt; y </strong>    so the  where  can be in front of either fielda or fieldb. i find that this can make for convoluted conditional logic to construct the query string. my usual  trick  is to put in a  where  clause that s true for all records in the table so that fielda and fieldb  if they are included  will always have an  and  before them. something like    <strong>strsql =  select * from tablea where fieldc > 0 </strong>    <strong>if condition1 true</strong>    <strong>strsql = strsql +    and fielda > x </strong>    <strong>end if</strong>    <strong>if condition2 true</strong>    <strong>strsql = strsql +    and fielda &lt; b </strong>    <strong>end if</strong>    is there a better way to achieve this other than using more conditional logic in my code,sql

handling command output in python  i want to work with the output of a wifi scan command. the output is several lines and i am interested in 2 information out of it. the goal is to have the essid and the address in a two dimmension array (hope thats right ) here is what i got so far:   <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python import subprocess import re from time import sleep  # set wifi interface wif =  wlan0  </code></pre>   so i get the command stdout and i find out that to work with this output in a loop i have to use iter   <pre><code># check for wifis nearby wifi_out = subprocess.popen([ iwlist   wif   scan ] stdout=subprocess.pipe) wifi_data = iter(wifi_out.stdout.readline   ) </code></pre>   then i used enumerate to have the index and therefore i search for the line with the address and the next line (index + 1) would contain the essid   <pre><code>for index  line in enumerate(wifi_data):     searchobj = re.search( r .* cell [0-9][0-9] - address: .*   line  re.m|re.i)     if searchobj:         print index  line         word = line.split()         wifi = [word[4] wifi_data[index + 1]] </code></pre>   now i have two problems <br/> 1) wifi_data is the wrong type <br/>     <code>typeerror:  callable-iterator  object has no attribute  __getitem__ </code> <br/> 2) i guess with <br/>     <code>wifi = [word[4] wifi_data[index + 1]]</code> <br/> i set the the variable every time new instead of have something that appends. but i want a variable that in the and has all essids together with all corresponding addresses.  i am new with python  so currently i imaging something like   <pre><code>wifi[0][0] returns essid wifi[0][1] returns address to essid in wifi[0][0] wifi[1][0] returns next essid wifi[1][1] returns address to essid in wifi[1][0] </code></pre>   and so on. or would be something else in python better to work with such kind of information,python

what is the default __hash__ in python   i am quite often using funky stuff as keys for dictionaries  and therefore  i am wondering what is the right way to do it - and this goes through implementing good hash methods for my objects. i am aware of other questions asked here like <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2909106/python-whats-a-correct-and-good-way-to-implement-hash >good way to implement <strong>hash</strong></a>  but i d like to understand how the default <code>__hash__</code> works for custom objects  and if it is possible to rely on it.      i have noticed that mutables are explicitely unhashable since <code>hash({})</code> raises an error ... but strangely  custom classes are hashable :   <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class object(object): pass &gt;&gt;&gt; o = object() &gt;&gt;&gt; hash(o) </code></pre>   so  does anybody knows how this default hash function works   by understanding this  i d like to know :    can i rely on this default hash  if i put objects of a same type as keys of a dictionary   e.g. :   <pre><code>key1 = myobject() key2 = myobject() key3 = myobject() {key1: 1  key2:  blabla   key3: 456} </code></pre>   can i rely on it if i use objects of different types as keys in a dictionary   e.g.   <pre><code>{int: 123  myobject(10):  bla    plo : 890} </code></pre>   and in the last case also  how to make sure that my custom hashes don t clash with the builtin hashes   e.g :   <pre><code>{int: 123  myobject(10):  bla   myobjectwithcustomhash(123): 890} </code></pre>,python

getting center for python objects  i have the following piece of code from a practice exam for my upcoming final.    <pre><code>cir=circle(point(100 100) 50) rect=rectangle(point(50 50) point(100 100)) line=line(point(50 50) point(80 80)) point=point(50 100) </code></pre>   the question asks the following lines of code that don t work  which can be more than one.    i am not sure which is the right answer:   <pre><code>1. cir.getx().getcenter()  2. rect.getcenter().getx()  3. line.getx()  4. point.getx()  5. point.getcenter() </code></pre>   the choices are:   <pre><code>a) 1 and 5 b) 3 c) 1 and 3 d) 2 and 3 e) 1 3 and 5 </code></pre>   i thought that 3 is wrong because you cant get an x value from a line and 5 is wrong because a point wouldn t have a center so those options aren t available. any insights would be helpful.,python

very large number calculations with no loss in accuracy   very large number calculations with no loss in accuracy      given a 1700 digit number  we want to store the value and perform two functions on it with no loss of accuracy  its ok if calc time takes longer but better if faster.    where <code>x</code> = a 1700 digit long numeric value    the two calcs to be computed with be ;    <code>x</code> * (up to a four digit value )    then we take the modulus of this resultant of 400 ;   <pre><code>( x % 400 ) </code></pre>   if we cant multiply  [ <code>x</code> * (up to a four digit value ) ] and then take the modulus due to  processing bottlenecks  ceilings - then can this be done where we first take the modulus of the original <code>x</code> = 1700 digits and then multiply this by the four digit value and then take the modulus of this after   ideally id prefer to be able to do the first scenario.    constraints im aware of regarding this to date ;    firstly  im only running on a winxp 32 bit system and not able to upgrade currently.    secondly  ive been becoming aware of a lot of issues  bugs  errors with python  sympy  etc.. in properly handling very large number calcs.  these problems seem to arise out of data loss through use of floats and related.  details on a number of different approaches can be viewed here ;    <a href= https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sympy/eufw6c_nhdi  rel= nofollow >https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sympy/eufw6c_nhdi</a> <a href= https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sympy/hgoq74izlkk  rel= nofollow >https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sympy/hgoq74izlkk</a>    my system will not properly handle  float128  floats  although ive been told by one person this would be able to handle wsuch a computation - altho the prob is it seems that float128 is rarely actually a 128 float and certainly not on my system. also due to internal processing peculiarties it seems that most floats will lose data on these kinds of computations.  if i understand correctly  one of the best  candidates for getting the most accurate values returned involves the use of arbitrary precision and representing the inputs as strings and not just straight numeroc values   also  ideally  id like the formula to be able to handle rationals without accuracy loss.  so   x  starts off as a whole number  but when i multiply it by the four digit value  id like that value to be any numeric value such as an integer  whole number or rational like  2243.0456 .    structure of one of the methods ive been experimenting with ;   <pre><code>from sympy import mpmath mpmath.mp.dps = 1700 x = (mpmath.mpf  insert 1700 digit number here  (x % 400) </code></pre>   an example with live data ;   <pre><code>from sympy import mpmath mpmath.mp.dps = 1700 x = (mpmath.mpf 4224837741562986738552195234618134569391350587851527986076117152972791626026988760293885754068768475423919991676816860701478996539715076968649431668262941552499272851934021744703799728797962346859481772141964720120813934781420732260156446701740408591264289745960985811289070246238359268267313892549883722768575435935465369820850766441187744058828599331364172396647692768693734233545999439071435129082764340446292057962343360114463696515950803159895238667237356887294549618489296157716384494295159851060500050371940523385701946860964162569067371175357615144192344763876540813882107379891591055307476597279137714860430053785074855035948744902479909111840444834198237419177418965268614345042634655648237818899253116247916585686713243193074635608527160273611309051938762676520507404815180792793701259216609316118483835216791263172902470123821111779223204735647931377027227055312940934756325611832463728974558417085791096461266371917752574370345933533929245534623041989305973992490523694190318284666464757159324866096861573704540654160644711274766759520501013633999706244117691235878123489694261724158073725644897527727473450037615295487637338687848351441331386946416003718795419822246935787682977520303924734875834943985619000970655639767984458204513958680501990182471695393372003272654902387493955849775308922901631024199011283441050881608686856746206012270890984260424834329551281249797545775091226433669036680463406283858413423722935297859778786945935751468048494081427689669730664660260908636113264573712854536295005312934569838992758429422872122606102877623867968067833225444280667381025371705347744037508121975424674439904984528128036994803804742198422695627759844248  (x % 400) </code></pre>   but i have no idea if accurate results are being returned with this  would love to hear anyones suggestions,python

python cgi script for sound hangs when played twice  i have a python cgi script (see below) that plays a song via a pi’s audio jack output. it’s called via the web (the pi runs apache). it works just fine. however  i noticed this: when i play it the first time  the sound plays and the script terminates right away after the song has played. good. when i run it right again via the browser  the sound will play  but instead of terminating when the sound is played  there is a hiss continuing for 3 seconds or so. if i call the script again while the hiss is there  it will hang. if i terminate the hanging script  by pressing control-c and then call it again  it will play the sound twice  as if the process from the previous instance somehow got queued and then released when the script was called again.    what i’d like to accomplish  is that every time the script is called via the web  it will either play the sound right away (and terminate any pre-existing sound processes)  or it will at least not hang  wait until previous sound processes are done  and then play its sound and terminate.     the problem is the hanging.     thanks for any help on this!    marc.   <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- # enable debugging import cgitb cgitb.enable() import cgi  form = cgi.fieldstorage() arguments = cgi.fieldstorage()  import pygame  def loopsound(n name):     for x in range(0  n):         pygame.mixer.init()         pygame.mixer.music.load( /var/www/html/sounds/ +name+ .mp3 )         pygame.mixer.music.play(0)         while pygame.mixer.music.get_busy() == true:#            continue             continue         pygame.mixer.quit()  loopsound(1 form.getvalue( sound ))  print  content-type: text/plain;charset=utf-8  print  print  hi hello world! \r\n  </code></pre>,python

trying to add a specific column from a split list  i have an input file that i need to split.  the file could have any number of lines  but on each line there are 4 things.  first is a region code  next is a number of fiction books sold in that region  next is the number of nonfiction books sold in region and last is the tax for that region (example:  tx 493 515 0.055).  i ve figured out everything i need to do with the program that i need to do except summing up all the total of fiction books  nonfiction books and total sales.  say there were just three total lines and fictionbooks sold for each region were 493  500  489 and obviously they are each on separate lines.  here is what i wrote and was wondering what am i doing wrong:   <pre><code>while (myfile !=   ):      myfile = myfile.split()     sumfiction = 0     for i in range(myfile):         sumfiction = sumfiction + eval(myfile[1]) </code></pre>   if i split the file of (co 493 515 0.055) wouldn t co be myfile[0]  493 be myfile[1]  etc.  any help would be appreciated.    edit: sorry  i should have been a bit more specific. i m reading from a file  and lets say this file has 3 lines(but my code needs to be for an unlimited amount of lines):   <pre><code>tx 415 555 0.55 mn 330 999 0.78 ha 401 674 0.99 </code></pre>   first is region code  then it s amount of fiction books sold  then amount of nonfiction books sold and then tax for that region.  i need to figure out total amount of books sold in region etc  which i ve done.  only thing i can t figure out is how to sum up all three lines of fiction books sold (ex: 415  330  401). here is code so far:   <pre><code>def computesales(fictionbooks nonfictionbooks areatax):     total = (fictionbooks * 14.95) + (nonfictionbooks * 9.95)     tax = total * areatax     totalsales = total + tax      return total tax totalsales  def main():     #infile = input( please enter name of book data file:   )     #infile = open(infile  r )     infile = open( pa7.books   r )     myfile = infile.readline()      print()     print( {0:14}{1:10} .format(    units sold ))     print( {0:10}{1:11}{2:17}{3:12}{4:8}{5:11} .format(                  region   fiction   non-fiction   total   tax   total sales ))     print( --------------------------------------------------------------------- )      while (myfile !=   ):         myfile = myfile.split()         sumfiction = 0         #for i in range(myfile):             #sumfiction = sumfiction + eval(myfile[1])          total tax totalsales = computesales(eval(myfile[1]) eval(myfile[2]) eval(myfile[3]))          print( {0:2}{1:10}{2:13}{3:4}{4:14.2f}{5:10.2f}{6:16.2f} .format(                       myfile[0] myfile[1] myfile[2] total tax totalsales))          myfile = infile.readline()       print( --------------------------------------------------------------------- )     #print( {0:11}{1:13}{2:34}{3:2}{4:8} .format(     #              total   15035   3155   $   272843.41 ))     print(sumfiction)  main() </code></pre>,python

my camera following algorithm (images included)  this was my old algorithm   <pre><code>def spawn(self):     self.position_move() #to adjust when the player is spawned def position_move(self):     #gets called everytime the player moves     camera.x = -object.x+window.size[0]/2.0     camera.y = -object.y+window.size[1]/2.0 </code></pre>   it worked well though when i approached a corner  i could see the  outside  of the room. <img src= https://i.stack.imgur.com/pbexm.png  alt= enter image description here >    the whole purpose of my updated algorithm is to prevent seeing the  outside  of the room:   <pre><code>    def spawn(self): #when the player is first spawned         self.position_move() #to adjust when the player is spawned      def position_move(self):             #camera.x = -(top left x corner of camera coordinate)             #camera.y = -(top left y corner of camera coordinate)              #room_size= total room (or world) size          diff=(object.x-window.size[0]/2)         if diff&lt;0:             camera.x = object.x+diff         else:             diff=(object.x+window.size[0]/2)-room_size[0]             if diff&lt;0:                 camera.x = -object.x+window.size[0]/2.0         diff=(object.y-window.size[1]/2)          if diff&lt;0:             camera.y = diff+window.size[1]/2         else:             diff=room_size[1]-(object.y+window.size[1]/2)              if diff&gt;0:                 camera.y = -object.y+window.size[1]/2.0 </code></pre>   my idea for the updated algorithm was to translate the camera back into the room by how much it is outside the room. though my updated algorithm for some reason goes wonky sometimes (flies away  or doesn t even follow the player).    so yeah  it is a little complicated for what i thought was a simple task. does anyone know the error is in my algorithm     (the framework i am using has a coordinate system like this) <img src= https://i.stack.imgur.com/oxzyj.png  alt= enter image description here >,python
logic of submitting multiple jobs to job scheduler using python  i am writing some code to submit multiple jobs to a job scheduler.     the code:   <pre><code>def submit_copasi_job_sge(self run_script_name copasi_file new_report_name):     ct=cluster_tools() #initialize a custom class     ct.change_scan_report_name(copasi_file new_report_name) # use a custom function     with open(run_script_name+ .sh   w ) as f: #write a .sh script for submission to the job scheduler         f.write( #!/bin/bash\n#$ -v -cwd\nmodule add apps/copasi\ncopasise {} .format(copasi_file))     os.system( qsub {} .format(run_script_name)) # submit to the job scheduler     os.remove(run_script_name) # remove the run script  def submit_multi_copasi_job_sge(self run_script_name copasi_file new_report_name n):     ct=cluster_tools() #initialize custom class     run_script_vec=[]  #create a numbered list of run script names     for i in range(n):          run_script_vec.append(run_script_name+ _ +str(i))     print run_script_vec     for i in run_script_vec: #iterate over the run scripts with the previously defined function          ct.submit_copasi_job_sge(i copasi_file new_report_name+str(i)) </code></pre>   the first part will submit a job to the job scheduler. this is tested and it works. now however i am trying to write a function to iterate over the first function to submit the same job multiple times (with different output file names  hence the  change_scan_report_name  bit of the first function).     the error i get is the following:   <pre><code>  file  /home/b3053674/models/retinoic_acid/fit5/copasi_tools.py   line 307  in submit_copasi_job_sge     os.remove(run_script_name) oserror: [errno 2] no such file or directory:  /home/b3053674/models/retinoic_acid/fit5/run_0.sh  </code></pre>   i suspect this is a logic problem  but i m baffled and think this should work. can anybody spot the bug,python
memoization decorator  i have the following pseudocode:   <pre><code>class myclass()   def slow_method(self):      try:          return self.memo_slow_method      except:          self.memo_slow_method = some_slow_function()          return self.memo_slow_method </code></pre>   is it possible build a memoization decorator that performs <strong>exactly</strong> this logic     restrictions:   <ul> <li>though memo_slow_method doesn t need to be directly accessible  it must be defined on the object  such that it is cleaned up when object itself is purged- <strong>very important</strong>.</li> <li>there s no need to consider parameters other than <code>self</code> - no parameters will ever be passed.</li> </ul>   ps i have been using @lrucache but it s not suitable for my purposes. it really needs to follow the above logic exactly.,python

adding result of a slot machine roll in loop  i may have a hard time explaining my issue  so bare with me.  i am trying to create a program that works like a slot machine.  in my loop  i am trying to determine how many credits a player gets based on the result of their spin(s).  however  say when a player rolls and wins 300 credits  when asked to spin again  if they win another time  it doesn t remember the result of the former spin.    i know this is a simple fix  but basically each time the loop goes back again it forgets their updated total.  i am new to programming  and this stuff is confusing as all hell to me.    here s what i have for the loop section:   <pre><code>cashpool = 500  import random  # assigning wheel properties wheel1 = [ candy   ghost   pumpkin   cat   zombie   witch   witch   cat   ghost   candy ] wheel2 = [ candy   ghost   pumpkin   cat   zombie   witch   cat   pumpkin   ghost   candy ] wheel3 = [ candy   ghost   pumpkin   cat   zombie   witch   pumpkin   candy   candy   ghost ]  #loop to spin   def askyesno(question):     tmp = input(question).lower()     if tmp.startswith( y ):         return true     else:         return false  i = 0  while true:     spin1 = random.randint(3 4)     spin2 = random.randint(3 4)     spin3 = random.randint(3 4)     print(str(wheel1[spin1])+  \t  + str(wheel2[spin2]+  \t  + str(wheel3[spin3])))     i += 1     if spin1==4 and spin2==4 and spin3==4:         print( congratulations! you have won 300 credits )         result = cashpool + 300         print( you currently have  + str(result) +  credits )     if spin1==5 and spin2==5 and spin3==5:         print( congratulations! you have won 250 credits )         result = cashpool + 250         print( you currently have  + str(result)+   credits )     if spin1==3 and spin2==3 and spin3==3:         print( congratulations! you have won 200 credits )         result = cashpool + 200         print( you currently have  +cashpool+  credits )     if spin1==2 and spin2==2 and spin3==2:         print( congratulations! you have won 150 credits )         result = cashpool + 150         print( you currently have  +cashpool+  credits )     if spin1==1 and spin2==1 and spin3==1:         print( congratulations! you have won 100 credits )         result = cashpool + 100         print( you currently have  +cashpool+  credits )     if spin1==0 and spin2==0 and spin3==0:         print( congratulations! you have won 50 credits )         result = cashpool + 50         print( you currently have  +cashpool+  credits )     askyesno( would you like to spin  enter y/n  )     if false:         break </code></pre>   also  i m 100% sure there is an easier way to calculate the results of each spin rather than doing if statements over and over.  but again  i m new  and that s beyond me.  i can t think like a programmer  i don t know how people do it.,python
