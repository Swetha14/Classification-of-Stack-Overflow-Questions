issue with tab bar view displaying a compound view  i created a tab bar application  and i make the first tab a table. so i create a tableview controller  and go about setting the class identity of the view controller for the first tab to my tableview controller.    this works fine  and i see the contents of the table filling up the whole screen.    however  this is not what i actually want in the end goal - i would like a compound window having multiple views: - the aforementioned table - a custom view with data in it    so what i do is create a nib for this content (call it contentnib)  change the tab s class from the tableview controller to a generic uiviewcontroller  and set the nib of that tab to this new contentnib.    in this new contentnib i drag on a tableview and set file s owner to the tableviewcontroller. i then link the datasource and delegate to file s owner (which is tableviewcontroller).    surprisingly this does not work and i receive the error:   <pre><code>**terminating app due to uncaught exception  nsinvalidargumentexception   reason:  *** -[uiviewcontroller tableview:numberofrowsinsection:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x3b0f910 ** </code></pre>   this is bewildering to me since the file s owner is the tableviewcontroller  which has been assigned to be both the datasource and delegate. does someone have either insight into my confusions  or a link to an example of how to have a compound view include a tableview      *****update**** i see this in the apple tableview programming guide:  note: you should use a uiviewcontroller subclass rather than a subclass of uitableviewcontroller to manage a table view if the view to be managed is composed of multiple subviews  one of which is a table view. the default behavior of the uitableviewcontroller  class is to make the table view fill the screen between the navigation bar and the tab bar (if either are present). * <strong>&lt;----- i don t really get what this is telling me to do though... if someone can explain or point me to an example i d be much appreciated!</strong>,iphone

problem with setcontentoffset:animated:yes  i m having a problem with what almost seems like a bug in ios. i m trying to do some really simple scrolling in a uiscrollview. if i scroll to a point with an animation  it scrolls there perfectly fine  but it <em>doesn t set the point to the scrollview</em>. i.e. when i scroll to somewhere else later  it jumps up to 0 0 and starts the animation from there.    i m using the following code   <pre><code>[scrollview setcontentoffset:cgpointmake(0  95) animated:yes]; nslog(@ offset x %@   [[nsnumber numberwithfloat:scrollview.contentoffset.x] stringvalue]); nslog(@ offset y %@   [[nsnumber numberwithfloat:scrollview.contentoffset.y] stringvalue]); </code></pre>   which produces output   <pre><code>offset x 0 offset y 0 </code></pre>   while the exact same code with the animation off:   <pre><code>[scrollview setcontentoffset:cgpointmake(0  95) animated:no]; nslog(@ offset x %@   [[nsnumber numberwithfloat:scrollview.contentoffset.x] stringvalue]); nslog(@ offset y %@   [[nsnumber numberwithfloat:scrollview.contentoffset.y] stringvalue]); </code></pre>   produces output   <pre><code>offset x 0 offset y 95 </code></pre>   i m trying to automatically scroll to a uitextview so i m listening to some keyboard notifications where i normally do the scrolling. but i ve done this test in viewdidload and it produces these results.    doing scrollview.contentoffset = cgpointmake(0 95); also sets the value correctly. it s just the animated one that doesn t.    edit: the code i am actually trying to run is this:   <pre><code>- (void)textfielddidbeginediting:(uitextfield *)textfield {     //60 is half the available space in portrait mode so it puts the textfield in the centre.     [self.scrollview setcontentoffset:cgpointmake(0  textfield.frame.origin.y-60) animated:yes]; } </code></pre>   which scrolls the view to the correct position. but since it doesn t seem to set contentoffset correctly it starts the animation from 0 0 all the time. now matter how long i wait between the animations.,iphone

different width for diffent sections in tableview  as in screenshot i want to create a grouped tableview to get that kinda look and feel. i am taking uitextfield within every cell. but for ist 3 rows on above i need that section to be thinner in width. even in case of rows below cells will not take as much as the width as the tableview takes. what i ma doing i am minimizing the width of tableview from left and setting the background view s color to groupedtableviewstyle color which merges with the tableview background(but the that view background does not contain the scroll property as it is not within the tableview). is it possible to have different width for different sections in tableview even if i customize the cells  i am open to any other suggestion too. i m not sure taking two different tableview would be a good option or not     <img src= https://i.stack.imgur.com/i0sdp.png  alt= enter image description here >,iphone

how to implement a loadingscreen correctly  i have built my loadingview and it looks good now. but i cant figue out the right moment to show and remove this loadingview. i use a navigationcontroller with my initial rootviewcontroller wich has a uibutton. when pressing the uibutton a new uiview appears  but this takes a few seconds cuz i m loading some files from a server. so i want to show my loadingview during this time. i use the prepareforsegue()-method and there i put the code to add my loading view like this   <pre><code>[self.navigationcontroller.view addsubview:backgroundloadingview]; </code></pre>   and in the viewdiddisapperar i put this line of code   <pre><code>[backgroundloadingview removefromsuperview]; </code></pre>   the effect is  when i press the uibutton nothing happens for a few seconds (becuase of loading the files)and the loadingview does not pop up (but i should)  the new viewcontroller appears  the loadingview pops up for a second and disappears. so it disapperas in the right moment i guess but it does not come up in the right monent. how can i handle this situation     edit: hers is my prepareforsegue-method   <pre><code>- (void)prepareforsegue:(uistoryboardsegue *)segue sender:(id)sender </code></pre>   {   <pre><code>if([segue.identifier isequaltostring:@ showpointsonmap ]) {     nslog(@ here is prepareforsegue() );     [self.navigationcontroller.view addsubview:backgroundloadingview];     [self preparejsondata:[self getjsondata]];     [segue.destinationviewcontroller setpointarray:thepointarray]; } </code></pre>   },iphone
download additioanal functionality into an app - is it possible   i m currently developing an iphone version of existing android application. customer wants to provide his web services via mobile apps. on android this is made in a modular way: user installs main app  and then he can download additional modules to it if needed. that way he can install only modules that he needs. is there a way to achieve same functionality on iphone  i read about in-app purchasing  but i don t know if it will work because additional functionality will not be built-in and unlocked - it needs to be downloaded and added to my app as a new module - so user s space would not be wasted with unneeded modules.    thank you!,iphone

need help on didrecievememorywarning in iphone  i am developing an application which has almost 12 view controllers. application has tabbar with 4 tabs means four view controllers and there are multiple views to navigate in each tab bar. please note each tab has a navigationcontroller with a rootviewcontroller being its firstview. application is an extensive database application. when i run on simulator it works nice but get didrecieve memory warning while running on the device. i have few questions regarding the same.    <strong>note: i have checked the application using instruments tool for leaks and there are no red pyramids which means there are no leaks in the code.</strong>   <ol> <li> what is the best practise when you deal with multiple view controllers. </li> <li> when i recieve memory warning  i call [self deleteobjects] which deletes all the instances which are retaning the values for the current controller. but i am not confident if this the right way. what should be done when we recieve memory warnings. is there any good tutorial for that. (links plz) </li> <li> also how to make sure that the [self deleteobjcts] is not called for the visible controller.  (i was calling the deleteobjects method in viewdidunload method before but since we do [super didrecievememorywarning] it breaks the code as viewdidload is called in hierarch from top to bottom so once i deleted object for top viewcontroller obviously there will be error for rest of the controllers.) </li> </ol>   some of the basic confusing questions for me are as follows:   <ol> <li> why the memory warnings are not consistent. like i get them sometimes at the start whereas sometimes there are no warnings.  </li> <li> when we used [nsdate date]  [uiimage imagenamed:@ ... ]  [nsstring stringwithformat] etc  we dont own these objects and we dont have to release them but how can we make sure these objects are relased when we recieve a memory warning. </li> <li> i am using nsmutablearray at multiple places. in this arrays i store the [nsstring stringwithformat ]  [uiimage imagenamed...] objects  so when i realease the arrays do i need to relase the objects in the arrays though i dont own them. </li> </ol>   though this is a big list of question but i appreciate your help and time since i am in last stage of my development i am facing these major challenges.,iphone
does nssortdescriptor can sort array with datetime type   here is my code:   <pre><code>nssortdescriptor *sortdescriptor; sortdescriptor = [[nssortdescriptor alloc] initwithkey:@ inspectiondatetime                                                   ascending:yes];   nsarray *sortdescriptors = [nsarray arraywithobject:sortdescriptor]; sortedarray = [listallproject sortedarrayusingdescriptors:sortdescriptors];  [sortedarray sortedarrayusingcomparator:^nscomparisonresult(id obj1  id obj2)  {      uds_projectfield *projectfield1 = obj1;      uds_projectfield *projectfield2 = obj2;        return [projectfield1.inspectiondatetime compare:projectfield2.inspectiondatetime];      return  yes;  }]; </code></pre>   i use this to sort an array of a table in database which has field name  inspectiondatetime  type datetime  but the result is not correct.     this is the result    15/2/12 15/1/12 12/3/12    but expecting result is 12/3/12 15/2/12 15/1/12    so the question is nssortdescriptor can sort datetime type  if not please show me another way,iphone

is there something better than an nstimer  when time is absolutely crucial   i remember there were some kind of fancy  super-special calayer types or classes for cases where timing is absolutely crucial to the app. i want to flash a calayer in a certain frequency which triggers an light sensor and transmits data over light. similar to ir remote controls. it s an experiment. i need to let it flash between 5 and 50 times per second  with different durations between 0.02 and 0.2 seconds.    an nstimer just scedules something on the run loop  but i guess that it doesn t guarantee anything. i even remember it can happen that some callbacks just drop out  so it s not really good for crucial high-precision timing  isn t it     can anyone remember what kind of sync/timing calayer stuff this is that could help  or is opengles my best friend here,iphone

context sensitive app for iphone  for something like the notes or reminders on the iphone  apple makes the app look like a yellow sheet of notepad paper  or a white sheet of notepad paper.  i was wondering the basic premise on how someone goes about that.      for the reminders app  i m guessing they just use that off-white color for the background of the tableviewcell  and have that double red line on each tableviewcell on the lhs that makes it look like a sheet of school paper.    for the notes app  no clue.  any thoughts on either of these   i kind of wanted a rough idea of how hard it is to make something like this.  thanks.,iphone

viewdidload not the right command  i can t seem to find what i am looking for in the apple documentation.  i am saving a simple string to an nsuserdefaults location and i want it to load that string into a uitextfield in a view that i have already created.  everything is working great with the data persistence (it is saving and loading correctly) but it will only load the information on viewdidload.  the user edits the field in a modal view so when i call dismissmodalviewcontrolleranimated  the view does not register the updated uitextfield because viewdidload is not being called for the first time.  (hope i am explaining this coherently enough - i apologize)    how can i have it update that uitextfield immediately so the user can see their updated field   i don t think viewdidappear is the correct place but i can t figure out where to put it.,iphone

touchesended  i have a simple opengl:es application running (it is a game).  the game loads and presents the user with a  new game button  and then you are in the game.  i m using touchesbegan / touchesended to handle the touches.  then i take the coordinates and process them accordingly.    i also have an nstimer running at 30hz that calls renderscene which draws the on screen graphics.      every once in a while on the device (i have yet to have this happen on the simulator) i don t get anymore touch events after the first one.  i have attempted to debug this on the device and it appears that after i get the first touchesended event come in  the device is bombarded by touchesended calls.  i never get another touchesbegan call when this happens.  if i press home and come back into the game  everything will usually work fine.     here is the code for my input  as it exists in my eaglview.m code   <pre><code>#pragma mark     #pragma mark userinputstuff #pragma mark      #pragma mark  #pragma mark touchesbegan #pragma mark      - (void)touchesbegan:(nsset *)touches withevent:(uievent *)event {     uitouch *touch = [touches anyobject]; firsttouch = [touch locationinview:self]; lasttouch = [touch locationinview:self]; [(mygameappdelegate*)[[uiapplication sharedapplication] delegate]   handletouchevent:firsttouch];     }  #pragma mark     #pragma mark touchesended #pragma mark      - (void)touchesended:(nsset *)touches withevent:(uievent*)event  { uitouch *touch = [touches anyobject]; lasttouch = [touch locationinview:self]; [(mygameappdelegate*)[[uiapplication sharedapplication] delegate] handletouchended:lasttouch];   } </code></pre>   and here is the code as it exist in my app delegate   <pre><code>#pragma mark  #pragma mark handletouchended #pragma mark a function to react to the touch that is no longer present on the screen #pragma mark  - (void)handletouchended:(cgpoint)coordinate { if(_state == kstate_title) {     [self titlecollisiondetection:coordinate];     if(_buttonhighlighted)     {         _textures[ktexture_background] = [[texture2d alloc] initwithimage:[uiimage imagenamed:@ t4background.png ]];         glbindtexture(gl_texture_2d  [_textures[ktexture_background] name]);         gltexparameteri(gl_texture_2d  gl_texture_min_filter  gl_nearest);         gltexparameteri(gl_texture_2d  gl_texture_mag_filter  gl_nearest);                   [self resetgame];     } } } </code></pre>   and here is the code that configures the timer that fires to handle the renderer.   <pre><code>//start rendering timer _timer = [nstimer scheduledtimerwithtimeinterval:(1.0 / krenderingfps) target:self   selector:@selector(renderscene) userinfo:nil repeats:yes]; [uiapplication sharedapplication].idletimerdisabled = yes; </code></pre>   i m obviously doing something dumb.  what am i missing   why is touchesended firing so often,iphone

core location - problem initialising  i m looking for a bit of guidance from anyone who has worked with core location on the iphone. my app is almost complete  i m just trying to finish off one last thing for my client.    my app is to assist users with their workouts. similar functionality to mapmyrun. it has a timer screen with a start/stop button and a reset button. when the start button is tapped  the timer starts counting and core location starts tracking the users progress  calculating speed and distance. the issue i m having is with core location trying to find the users current location. scenario below:    <strong>day 1</strong> user has gone out for a jog and uses the app to track their progress  user has jogged for an hour  workout is saved. everything works as it should.     <strong>day 2</strong> user decides to go jogging again  this time in a different area than yesterdays jog. lets say 10 miles away. so they start the timer  but core location takes some time to initialise to the users current position. this causes the distance field to jump irrationally as core location tries to determine the current location.     i ve explained why this happens but my client is not very happy  they don t want to see the distance field jump  which is fair enough.     so i m wondering if anybody has a nice solution to initialising core location to the users current location. i could perhaps break the link between core location and the distance field for a certain period of time which will give core location a chance to get an accurate reading.    any help greatly appreciated.    regards  stephen,iphone

iphone sdk: problem with textfielddidendediting being called  in our app  in some cases  textfielddidendediting is not being fired. after some debugging  it was easy to see the reason why....textfieldshouldendediting was returning no when the current field is deemed invalid or in other words returning no from textfieldshouldendediting.    in the normal case  this behavior works just fine. however  if the user tries to cancel out of the form all together without every fixing the data problem flagged in textfieldshouldendediting  some critical code in textfielddidendediting is never being called because that event never fires if textfieldshouldendediting=no;    can anyone provide some suggestions on how to deal with this case     thanks.,iphone

iphone - pushed view blocked by invisible toolbar ( )  i have this uinavigationcontrol that has its toolbar visible and is showing the rootviewcontroller. then i push a new viewcontroller into the screen but i like the toolbar to be invisible  while this other viewcontroller is being shown.    then  to show the viewcontroller and hide the toolbar of the uinavigationcontrol i do this:   <pre><code>self.navigationcontroller.toolbar.hidden = yes; uiviewcontroller *newvc = [[uiviewcontroller alloc] init]; [self.navigationcontroller pushviewcontroller:newvc animated:yes]; </code></pre>   the problem is that any touch on this new view controller in the are correspondent where the toolbar was visible on the last view controller is not detected.    as you know  the toolbar sits on a rectangle at the bottom of the screen  has the screen width and 44 pixels high (if i am not wrong). so  the new pushed view controller responds to touch on its full view are except those on this rectangle.    see the following picture. i have 3 buttons. buttons 1 and 2 will respond to touches  but not button 3  because it is inside the area where the toolbar of the other view was...    and more than that  if i paint the background color of the new view with red  for example  the whole screen will be red  except for that bottom rectangle that will be white (and white is not the color of the previous view). i have checked and the view has 320 x 480...    <img src= https://i.stack.imgur.com/5s72u.png  alt= enter image description here >    any clues  thanks.,iphone

iphone: minimum os  deployment target & base/active sdk  i m a little confused about building an app for the app store and for the correct sdk &amp; os version. i have submitted my app to the app store  and in the app details screen of itunes connection it says:    <strong> minimum os requirements : 3.1.2 </strong>    i haven t seen any apps on the app store that have 3.1.2 as the min os  they all say 3.0. i read several things on here before i built it and i thought i understood everything!    basically  my app doesn t use any code that only exists in > 3.0 so i would like the minimum os to be 3.0. my build settings were:    <strong>target info</strong>   <ul> <li>base sdk: iphone device 3.0</li> <li>iphone os deployment target: iphone os 3.0</li> </ul>   <strong>xcode main window</strong>   <ul> <li>active sdk: iphone device 3.1.2</li> </ul>   i ve heard about a minimum os version being put in the info.plist but i haven t got anything like that in mine.    i build the app exactly like that and submitted it. are my app settings correct  will my app display 3.0 in the app store or 3.1.2  i m a little unsure as to why you set the active sdk to the latest (3.1.2) when you want to target 3.0   3.1 &amp; 3.12 devices  but it s what i read!    any help advice be greatly appreciated!,iphone

uisearchbar  crashing with exc_bad_access  this is kind of a weird error and not sure where to start.  we have a uisearchbar that used to work.  i don t believe we touched any of the code looking at subversion.  it stopped working all of a sudden in the simulator.  when i try typing anything in  i automatically get a exc_bad_access.  i tried running with instruments with zombies and no information was provided.  i then tried running it on the device  and it works fine.  any thoughts     also  i noticed that the new xcode update has ipad 5.0 simulator.  i tried it in that  and it works fine as well.  in a slightly separate but related question  i noticed that in that view where my view is presented  certain views are different in the ipad 4.3 simulator and ipad 5.0 simulator.  how does one go troubleshooting something like that   or did the way that views are handled through push/pop/addsubview change between ios 4 and ios 5   thanks.,iphone

numberofrowsinsection starts with last section  actually i m have a very simple problem (that s for sure) i just can t find the root cause.    the problem is  that after calling the numberofsectionsintableview method to get the number of sections (24 in my case) the method numberofrowsinsection gets called but with the last section (23).    this causes an out of bound index when scrolling.    so  what happens  i m receiving the data of the last section (23) and even the number of rows of the last section (23) and afterwards the sections are moving forward like 0 1 2 3 etc...    an example: i have a section with the section header  #  for special characters. in my case the last section is the  x  for all values beginning with an  x .    when i call my app  the section title has been set correctly to  #  but the data shows all the  x  values. at this point i have 31  x  values. when i now scroll to the last of the 31 rows  the app crashes because of an out of index error.    i think everything would work correctly if the sections wouldn t start with the last one and afterwards continue with the first ones (23 0 1 2 3 4 etc). i just can t find the place where or why the section hast the value 23 on the first place.    ---edit 2 begins: initialising the array:   <pre><code>    alphabetarray = [[nsmutablearray alloc] init]; </code></pre>   first i fill a dictionary like this (for all letters incl. special chars):   <pre><code>chardict = [[nsmutabledictionary alloc] init];  if ([charspecialarray count] &gt; 0)   {      [chardict setobject:charspecialarray forkey:@ special ];     [alphabetarray addobject:@ special ]; }  if ([charaarray count] &gt; 0) {      [chardict setobject:charaarray forkey:@ a ];     [alphabetarray addobject:@ a ]; } </code></pre>   ---edit 2 ends    so here i m just filling the first dictionary object with all  #  values (going on with all the other values)    then i call the numberofsectionsintableview method:   <pre><code>- (nsinteger)numberofsectionsintableview:(uitableview *)tableview {   return [chardict count]; } </code></pre>   here the numberofrowsinsection goes:   <pre><code>// customize the number of rows in the table view. - (nsinteger)tableview:(uitableview *)tableview numberofrowsinsection:(nsinteger)section {  nsstring *key = [alphabetarray objectatindex:section];   nsarray *array = [chardict objectforkey:key]; return [array count];  }  } </code></pre>   and the cellforrowatindexpath:   <pre><code>- (uitableviewcell *)tableview:(uitableview *)tableview cellforrowatindexpath:(nsindexpath *)indexpath {    static nsstring *cellidentifier = @ cell ;    uitableviewcell *cell = [tableview dequeuereusablecellwithidentifier:cellidentifier];   if(cell == nil)   cell = [[[uitableviewcell alloc] initwithstyle:uitableviewcellstylesubtitle reuseidentifier:@ myidentifier ] autorelease];  if ([charspecialarray count] &gt; 0)   {      char *charspecial = (char *)[[charspecialarray objectatindex:indexpath.section] objectatindex:indexpath.row];      cell.textlabel.numberoflines = 1;     cell.detailtextlabel.numberoflines = 2;     [cell.detailtextlabel setfont:[uifont boldsystemfontofsize: 12]];      cell.textlabel.text = charspecial.ta;     cell.detailtextlabel.text = charspecial.descriptionen; }  if ([charaarray count] &gt; 0) {      char *chara = (char *)[[charaarray objectatindex:indexpath.section] objectatindex:indexpath.row];      cell.textlabel.numberoflines = 1;                        cell.detailtextlabel.numberoflines = 2;     [cell.detailtextlabel setfont:[uifont boldsystemfontofsize: 12]];      cell.textlabel.text = chara.ta;     cell.detailtextlabel.text = chara.descriptionen;      } </code></pre>   again for all characters...    any suggestions how to fix that     <em>added</em> initialization code .h:   <pre><code>#import &lt;uikit/uikit.h&gt;  @interface char : nsobject { nsstring *ta; nsstring *report; nsstring *descriptionde; nsstring *descriptionen; }  @property (nonatomic  retain) nsstring *ta; @property (nonatomic  retain) nsstring *report; @property (nonatomic  retain) nsstring *descriptionde; @property (nonatomic  retain) nsstring *descriptionen;   -(id)initwithta:(nsstring *)t report:(nsstring *)re descriptionde:(nsstring *)dde     descriptionen:(nsstring *)den;  @end </code></pre>   initialization code .m:   <pre><code>#import  scode.h   @implementation char  @synthesize ta  report  descriptionde  descriptionen;  -(id)initwithta:(nsstring *)t report:(nsstring *)re descriptionde:(nsstring *)dde descriptionen:(nsstring *)den { self.ta = t; self.report = re; self.descriptionde = dde; self.descriptionen = den; return self; }  - (void)dealloc {  [ta release]; [report release]; [descriptionde release]; [descriptionen release]; [super dealloc]; }  @end </code></pre>,iphone

how do i move a block of code in a method for  efficiency  purposes   i think i have a conceptual misunderstanding and would appreciate an explanation.    within a class  i had the same block of code repeating 3 times (and working perfectly) but to try to make things more  efficient  i took it out and made a method within the class as follows:   <pre><code>- (void)dateup { nslog(@ dateup ); [uiview beginanimations:@ datepicker  context:nil]; [uiview setanimationduration:0.5];  datepicker.transform = cgaffinetransformmaketranslation(0 -310); [uiview commitanimations]; } </code></pre>   and then where the code originally was  i put:   <pre><code>[self dateup]; </code></pre>   and i put the following in my .h:   <pre><code>-(void)dateup; </code></pre>   i build and get this warning:   <pre><code>line location detailpopupview.m:165: warning: method definition for  -dateup   not found </code></pre>   and a crash with this in the console (and btw  the nslog statement doesn t appear in the console):   <pre><code>*** terminating app due to uncaught exception  nsinvalidargumentexception    reason:  *** -[detailpopupview dateup:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x3d33ef0  </code></pre>   any help appreciated.  one thing that i notice is that the console message has dateup: (with a colon) as if a parameter is expected.  so whereas the simplest solution is just to put the code back  repeating it 3x  i d like to know what i m doing wrong.    thanks.,iphone

iphone view strategy  i am developing an app but have yet to get the optimal navigation flow working.    to give you an idea of the structure of my app  i have a main view that allows the user to start a new game or view high scores. at the end of a game  i would like to give the user the choice of viewing high scores or going back to the main menu - i have a game over view for this.    the hierarchy looks something like this:   <pre><code>main view | +--game view |  | |  +--game over view |     | |     +--high scores view | +--high scores view </code></pre>   i am using the presentmodalviewcontroller method to switch from the game view to the game over view. this is fine  but when i want to go back to the main view i have two layers of views to navigate through (i want to close the game over view and the game view to return straight to the main view). to close views i am using dismissmodalviewcontrolleranimated but this is not ideal for traversing more than one view. is there a way of replacing the current model view rather than opening a new one on top     i hope this makes sense. please let me know if you need anymore details.    thanks in advance for any help.    alan,iphone

uitabbarcontroller and access commonly-used functions via protocol  i always use uiviewcontroller(as rootviewcontroller) to switch the view of 3 different uiviewcontrollers. there are some commonly-used  functions in the rootviewcontroller. i setup the protocol for the 3 different uiviewcontrollers to access. the actual function body codes are in rootviewcontroller.m if i want to call these function  i just need to write codes below in anyone of 3 uiviewcontroller to call the function  afunction  in rootviewcontroller.m   <pre><code>[mydelegate afunction]; </code></pre>   now  i hope to use uitabbarcontroller(as rootcontroller) to switch the view of 3 different uiviewcontrollers. i still hope to keep the mode above that store the commonly-used functions in the place where all 3 uiviewcontrollers can access via protocol.    where do these function codes need to be writen to     i can not find out the source codes body for uitabbarcontroller.

what do you want an iphone library to do for you   i m an undergraduate university student who also writes iphone applications.  next year i m expected to do a final project  something that lasts the full year and involves a fair bit of software engineering.    my original plan was to write an object-relational wrapper around sqlite for the iphone (or rather  to massively clean up and extend one i already have) and ultimately release it as open source.  unfortunately  with core data being added to iphone os 3.0  that s no longer really necessary.  (at least  that s how it seems to me; any opinions on this )    however  i d still like to do a useful  technically interesting iphone-related project next year.  so here s my question: what do developers need   what sort of problems do you encounter in your apps which seem like they could be handled by some sort of library or framework   my focus is generally more on utility  productivity  and communication apps than games.  and since i m proposing this to a university  something that s either theoretically interesting or attractive to potential students would be preferred.  and of course  it ll need to be something that they <em>haven t</em> added to the new version of iphone os.,iphone

iphone - app crashing with poor internet connection  i have an iphone app which communicates with a server to get the data being displayed. i have tested this app on a wifi connection and a good 3g connection. the app works without an issue. but if i test the app on a poor connection  the app crashes.    i get an xml from the server and parse it before displaying the data. i have put in the nsxmlparser method to show an alert if the parsing fails. the n/w connection code is also placed in try/catch blocks and we show an alert if the control goes to the catch block.    on a poor internet connection  the app just crashes (doesn t even go to the catch block) and checking the crash logs suggests the app could not get the complete response. shouldn t it go to the catch block in that case  (i am using a wrapper class to make a synchronous connection)    this will always be an issue in any app using the internet if the connection is poor. is there any way we can avoid this     thanks.    <b> i am using the <a href= http://kosmaczewski.net/2008/10/18/rest-and-objective-c-again/  rel= nofollow noreferrer >code provided here</a> as the base for creating connections and getting the response</b>,iphone

uiview cameraoverlayview in augmented reality starts in portrait mode  i m doing a bit of ar work here and one of the biggest problem right now is one of my uiview will not respond to any frame settings i make to it.    the code is very similar to this. i ve made a few major changes to incorporate into my project:    nurse.site11.com/jaredcrawford-iwvu-632a9a0/libraries/arkit/augmentedrealitycontroller.m     displayview  is used as a custom uiview that is passed to uiimagepickercontroller s setcameraoverlayview: method.    now in the initwithviewcontroller method of that augmentedrealitycontroller.m file  i have tried setting the displayview = [[uiview alloc] initwithframe:cgrectmakeframe(0  0  480  320)];    the problem is  even if i set it to displayview = [[uiview alloc] initwithframe:cgrectmakeframe(0  0  100  100)]; the view still remains full screen 320 x 480 but only for the first time the augmented reality view appeared. subsequent times that the ar view appears  the code works.    i am not sure what the heck is going on and why setting the frame of the displayview not affecting the view at all for the first time it is shown.    i m hoping someone else has experienced this problem before and possibly solved it.    this is my code:   <pre><code>- (id)initwithviewcontroller:(uiviewcontroller *)vc {     coordinates     = [[nsmutablearray alloc] init];     coordinateviews = [[nsmutablearray alloc] init];     latestheading   = -1.0f;     debugview       = nil;      [self setrootviewcontroller: vc];      [self setdebugmode:no];     [self setmaximumscaledistance: 0.0];     [self setminimumscalefactor: 1.0];     [self setscaleviewsbasedondistance: yes];     [self setrotateviewsbasedonperspective: yes];     [self setmaximumrotationangle: m_pi / 6.0];      //cgrect screenrect = [[uiscreen mainscreen] bounds];      nslog(@ inside initwithviewcontroller );          uideviceorientation orientation = [[uidevice currentdevice] orientation];      if(orientation == uideviceorientationportrait)     {         nslog(@ orientation portrait );     }     else if(orientation == uideviceorientationlandscaperight)     {         nslog(@ orientation right );         [[uiapplication sharedapplication] setstatusbarorientation:uiinterfaceorientationlandscapeleft];         [self setcurrentorientation:uideviceorientationlandscaperight];     }     else if(orientation == uideviceorientationportraitupsidedown)     {         nslog(@ orientation upsidedown );                  }     else if(orientation == uideviceorientationlandscapeleft){         nslog(@ orientation left );         [[uiapplication sharedapplication] setstatusbarorientation:uiinterfaceorientationlandscaperight];         [self setcurrentorientation:uideviceorientationlandscapeleft];     }      //[[uiapplication sharedapplication] setstatusbarorientation:uiinterfaceorientationlandscapeleft];       //nslog(@ in ar view  device orientation = %@   [[uidevice currentdevice] orientation]);      //[self setdisplayview: [[uiview alloc] initwithframe: screenrect]];     //[self setcurrentorientation:uideviceorientationlandscaperight];      displayview = [[uiview alloc] initwithframe:cgrectmake(-80  80  480  320)];       [displayview setbackgroundcolor:[uicolor colorwithred:0.0 green:0.0 blue:1.0 alpha:0.5]];      nslog(@ displayview x = %f   displayview.frame.origin.x);     nslog(@ displayview y = %f   displayview.frame.origin.y);     nslog(@ displayview width = %f   displayview.frame.size.width);     nslog(@ displayview height = %f   displayview.frame.size.height);      [[nsnotificationcenter defaultcenter] addobserver:self selector:@selector(deviceorientationdidchange:) name: uideviceorientationdidchangenotification object:nil];     [[uidevice currentdevice] begingeneratingdeviceorientationnotifications];      [[self rootviewcontroller] setview:displayview];     //[[self rootviewcontroller] setview:[[uiview alloc] initwithframe:cgrectmake(0  0  480  320)]];      //[[rootviewcontroller view] setbackgroundcolor:[uicolor bluecolor]];      cllocation *newcenter = [[cllocation alloc] initwithlatitude:37.41711 longitude:-122.02528];     [self setcenterlocation: newcenter];     [newcenter release];      [self startlistening];      [self deviceorientationupdate];      startlocation = nil;     i = 0;     objimageview = [[uiimageview alloc] initwithframe:cgrectmake(0 0 320 480)];     //[objimageview setbackgroundcolor:[uicolor bluecolor]];      blnhasrotated = no;      return self; } </code></pre>   the full code can be seen here: pastebin.com/g0exjapq,iphone

overriding selectable area of uitableviewcell   i m trying to avoid putting a button in my uitableviewcell subclass so that i don t unnecessarily lag up the scrolling speed.     the button would push another view onto the navigation stack.    i figured since uitableview already has built-in and optimized methods for managing this  that simply limiting the touchable area of my cells would be the easiest and most effective way of achieving my goal.    i really have no idea how i would implement something like this. i have a feeling i would have to override pointinside:withevent: or hittest:withevent:  but i m not sure how. managing touchevents and the uiresponder stuff still escapes me.    so my question is ultimately  in my rootviewcontroller  how would i implement that selecting a row will only work at lets say 220 10 40 40      thanks!,iphone

using nsscanner to scan up to and include the separator character   i have a string that s basically dates into a string with extra whitespace in some areas for formatting when showing the string.  so the string can look something like   <pre><code>6:00 pm  6:00 pm  4:00 am 6:00 pm  4:00 am 12:00 pm 6:00 pm  4:00 am 12:00 pm  1:00 am </code></pre>   i figured i could use nsscanner to parse the string by the @ m  since sometimes there are two spaces between times  sometimes a single space  etc.  so what i did was:   <pre><code>    nsscanner *thescanner = [nsscanner scannerwithstring:thestring];     nsstring *separatorstring = @ m ;     nsstring *container;     nsmutablearray *array = [[nsmutablearray alloc] initwithcapacity:_lastindexpath.row];      while ([thescanner isatend] == no) {         [thescanner scanuptostring:separatorstring intostring:&amp;container];         [array addobject:container];          [thescanner setscanlocation:[thescanner scanlocation] + 1];     } </code></pre>   the problem is i do not get the m in my container object since it scans up to but it doesn t include the separator string.  should i just manually create a new nsstring before adding it like   <pre><code>[array addobject:[nsstring stringwithformat:%@m   container]]; </code></pre>   or is there a better way to use nsscanner in this scenario   i really haven t used nsscanner before.  thanks.,iphone

is it possible to let the iphone system time run faster for a moment   maybe this can solve out the ugly delay with touchesbegan: to touchesmoved:. it is caused artifically by iphone os to check if the user really wants to move. in some situations the finger must be tracked without delay  otherwise it just looks ugly. you see that everywhere through iphone os. sliders  scroll views.    maybe accelerating the system time makes the delay smaller.,iphone

how can i take zooming into account when a user touches a uiscrollview   i have a uiimageview inside of a uiscrollview.  the parent scroll view allows zooming and panning.  when the user taps a point in the scroll view  i want to find the location in the raw image inside the uiimageview - i.e. i want the point after including any zooming and panning the user has done in the scroll view.    right now  i have a uiscrollview subclass called forwardingscrollview that handles touch events and attempts to convert them into locations in the coordinate system of the child image view.  i tried adding contentoffset to these points  tried multiplying them by zoomscale  and even tried doing both.  i also tried calling [touch locationinview: self] and [touch locationinview: parent]  but none of these methods correctly return the point that i clicked in the underlying image.    what s the best way to do this      thanks in advance.,iphone

iphone image processing--matrix convolution  i am implementing a matrix convolution blur on the iphone.  the following code converts the uiimage supplied as an argument of the blur function into a cgimageref  and then stores the rgba values in a standard c char array.     <pre><code>    cgimageref imageref = imgref.cgimage; int width = imgref.size.width; int height = imgref.size.height; cgcolorspaceref colorspace = cgcolorspacecreatedevicergb(); unsigned char *pixels = malloc((height) * (width) * 4); nsuinteger bytesperpixel = 4; nsuinteger bytesperrow = bytesperpixel * (width); nsuinteger bitspercomponent = 8; cgcontextref context = cgbitmapcontextcreate(pixels  width  height                                               bitspercomponent  bytesperrow  colorspace                                               kcgimagealphapremultipliedlast | kcgbitmapbyteorder32big);     cgcontextdrawimage(context  cgrectmake(0  0  width  height)  imageref); cgcontextrelease(context); </code></pre>   then the pixels values stored in the pixels array are convolved  and stored in another array.    <pre><code>unsigned char *results = malloc((height) * (width) * 4); </code></pre>   finally  these augmented pixel values are changed back into a cgimageref  converted to a uiimage  and the returned at the end of the function with the following code.   <pre><code>    context = cgbitmapcontextcreate(results  width  height                                  bitspercomponent  bytesperrow  colorspace                                  kcgimagealphapremultipliedlast | kcgbitmapbyteorder32big);

free(results); free(pixels); cgcolorspacerelease(colorspace);   return newimage; </code></pre>   this works perfectly  once.  then  once the image is put through the filter again  very odd  unprecedented pixel values representing input pixel values that don t exist  are returned.  is there any reason why this should work the first time  but then not afterward   beneath is the entirety of the function.   <pre><code>    -(uiimage*) blur:(uiimage*)imgref { cgimageref imageref = imgref.cgimage;

how to draw drop-down shadows in ios  a cashapelayer uses a cgpathref to draw it s stuff. so i have a star path  and i want a smooth drop shadow with a radius of about 15 units. probably there is some nice functionality in some new iphone os versions  but i need to do it myself for a old aged version of 3.0 (which most people still use).    i tried to do some really nasty stuff: i created a for-loop and sequentially created like 15 of those paths  transform-scaling them step by step to become bigger. then assigning them to a new created cashapelayer and decreasing it s alpha a little bit on every iteration. not only that this scaling is mathematically incorrect and sucks (it should happen relative to the outline!)  the shadow is not rounded and looks really ugly. that s why nice soft shadows have a radius.    the tips of a star shouldn t appear totally sharp after a shadow size of 15 units. they should be soft like cream. but in my ugly solution they re just as s harp as the star itself  since all i do is scale the star 15 times and decrease it s alpha 15 times. ugly.    i wonder how the big guys do it  if you had an arbitrary path  and that path must throw a shadow  how does the algorithm to do that work  probably the path would have to be expanded like 30 times  point-by-point relative to the tangent of the outline away from the filled part  and just by 0.5 units to have a nice blending.    before i re-invent the wheel  maybe someone has a handy example or link,iphone

iphone sleep mode and interaction with apps  to preface this question:  i ve never actually done iphone development.  haven t even downloaded the sdk yet.  this question arose while i was brainstorming about what kind of app might be interesting and feasible for me to create.  that said...    i know the iphone doesn t (yet) support multi-tasking  but i m curious what happens when it goes into sleep mode.  i notice on my wife s iphone that if i don t  do  anything for a period of time it goes into sleep mode.  the screen blanks  etc.    so would it be possible to create an app that did  something  every ~10s without respect to user input   or would that app stop doing  something  as soon as the phone goes to sleep,iphone

iphone - a question about navigationcontrollers and viewcontroller  i have a project based on xcode s navigationcontroller template. this template has a navigationcontroller and a rootviewcontroller.     from inside this rootviewcontroller i push a view and this view pushes a third view. something like:    navigationcontroller >> rootviewcontroller >> viewcontroller 1 >>  viewcontroller 2    now  from viewcontroller2 i want to access the navigationcontroller and the navigationcontroller.toolbar.     i know that every viewcontroller has the navigationcontroller property but my question do i have to do something when i push a new viewcontroller so this variable (on the view that is being pushed) will have a valid reference to the correct viewcontroller or all pushed views will always have a valid reference to the navigationcontroller     the reason for my question is that i am trying to access the navigationcontroller.toolbar  to make it invisible  and i am having no result.    thanks.,iphone

mfmailcomposeviewcontroller file attachment name with foreign characters  i have searched far and wide and was surprised nothing like this came up. i am trying to send an audio file email attachment (using mfmailcomposeviewcontroller) that has chinese/kanji characters in the file name. the weird thing is when i use a particular character in the file name  it becomes a long strand of weird characters when i receive the email.    with a file name like  å¹³æˆ23å¹´.m4a   the name of the attachment when i receive the email becomes something like  å¹³æˆ23ï¿½ /%1b%28b8%1b%24b7n%1b%28b25%1b%24...   it is the character  å¹´  that is causing this. if i delete that character  everything is fine. there might be another chinese/kanji character out there that might cause the same problem  but i have no idea how to even begin to fix this...i ve been pulling my hair out so hopefully someone can help me with this...    also a similar problem is that with certain email providers (works fine for gmail  yahoo  but not for something like gmboy.com)  if i have japanese characters in the file name  they fail to show up and gets replaced by an underscore sign. (e.g. testãƒ†ã‚¹ãƒˆ.m4a turns into  test_.m4a) i feel that this may be related to the problem above.    here s my code...   <pre><code>/* set up the mail compose view and put in the body/attachment */ mfmailcomposeviewcontroller *mailcomposer = [[[mfmailcomposeviewcontroller alloc] init] autorelease];  nsmutabledictionary *dict = [[self itemstosend] objectatindex:0]; nsstring *path = [dict objectforkey:@ exportfileaddress ]; nsdata *mydata = [nsdata datawithcontentsoffile:path]; nsstring *filename = @ å¹³æˆ23å¹´.m4a ; [mailcomposer addattachmentdata:mydata mimetype:@ audio/m4a  filename:filename];   [mailcomposer setmessagebody:@ test email  ishtml:yes];  /* set default subject */ [mailcomposer setsubject:@ email subject ];  mailcomposer.mailcomposedelegate = self;         [self presentmodalviewcontroller:mailcomposer animated:yes]; </code></pre>   the file attachment name will show up just fine when the mfmailcomposeviewcontroller view comes up  but somehow during the sending process  the name got screwed up.    any help will be greatly appreciated!,iphone

iphone uiimageview pinch zoom  i have been trying to implement pinch zoom/in-out for photoview (a uiimageview instance) using cgaffintransformscale (planing to use rotation so can not count on frames for the zoom and will add subviews so uiscrollview would be more complicated  i think). anyhow  the concept was easy enough to grasp and the code came together very quickly...since then i have been trying to solve the same two (related !) problems  using three different approaches  and have not be able to do so: 1- my code somehow loses track of the touch count in the middle of the zoom  from count = 2      to count = 1 and back on the iphone  but not the simulator.  2- the touch points one and two keep jumping back and forth a few pixels on every move  causing the image to shrink and enlarge successively and rapidly  even though overall the effect is one of zooming out or zooming in as the user intended (both iphone and simulator).    here s the code:   <pre><code>#import  photoview.h    @implementation photoview; @synthesize originalcenter  distance  zooming; - (id)initwithframe:(cgrect)frame {     if (self = [super initwithframe:frame]) {     // initialization code         self.userinteractionenabled = yes;         self.multipletouchenabled = yes;         zooming = no;     }     return self; }  float distancebetweentwopoints(cgpoint point1  cgpoint point2) {  nslog(@ point1 x: %5.2f point 2 x: %5.2f ---- point 1 y: %5.2f  point 2 y:    %5.2f  point1.x point2.x point1.y point2.y);     return (sqrt(pow(point1.x -point2.x 2) + pow(point1.y - point2.y 2))); } -(void) touchesbegan: (nsset *) touches withevent:(uievent *) event {      if ([touches count] &gt; 1) {        nslog(@ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^tocuhes began with double touch! );        distance = distancebetweentwopoints([[[touches allobjects] objectatindex:0] locationinview:self]           [[[touches allobjects] objectatindex:1] locationinview:self]);       zooming = yes;     }     else {        zooming = no;        origianlcenter = [[[touches allobjects] objectatindex:0] locationinview:self];        nslog(@ &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;touches began with single touch );     } } - (void)touchesended:(nsset *)touches withevent:(uievent *)event {      if (zooming) nslog(@ !!!!!!!!!end zoom!!!!!!! );      zooming = no;     if ([[touches anyobject] tapcount] == 2) {         uitouch *thistouch = [touches anyobject];         cgpoint thispoint = [thistouch locationinview:self];     } }  - (void) touchesmoved: (nsset *) touches withevent:(uievent *) event {     if ([touches count] &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; zooming) { // ignore if user added a second finger touch         float distancenew = distancebetweentwopoints([[[touches allobjects] objectatindex:0]     locationinview:self]                    [[[touches allobjects] objectatindex:1] locationinview:self]);           if (distance &lt;= 0.f) {    // should never be true - but it is sometimes!!!            distance = distancenew;         }           float delta = 1.0f + ((distancenew-distance)/distance);         self.transform = cgaffinetransformscale(self.transform  delta  delta);         distance = distancenew;     }     else {        if (zooming) {           nslog(@ *************shouldn t be here********* %d  [touches count]);           return;        }        cgpoint thispoint = [[[touches allobjects] objectatindex:0] locationinview:self];        self.transform = cgaffinetransformtranslate(self.transform  thispoint.x-originalcenter.x  thispoint.y-originalcenter.y);      } } - (void)dealloc {     [super dealloc]; } @end </code></pre>   the log sample:   <pre><code>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^tocuhes began with double touch! point1 x: 87.33 point 2 x: 235.63 ---- point 1 y: 322.30  point 2 y: 117.09 point1 x: 90.76 point 2 x: 232.02 ---- point 1 y: 318.29  point 2 y: 123.51 point1 x: 86.22 point 2 x: 236.71 ---- point 1 y: 323.30  point 2 y: 117.42 point1 x: 89.51 point 2 x: 232.38 ---- point 1 y: 319.47  point 2 y: 123.47 point1 x: 84.97 point 2 x: 237.02 ---- point 1 y: 324.48  point 2 y: 116.56 *************shouldn t be here********* 1 point1 x: 88.49 point 2 x: 232.52 ---- point 1 y: 321.27  point 2 y: 122.91 *************shouldn t be here********* 1 point1 x: 83.95 point 2 x: 237.11 ---- point 1 y: 327.21  point 2 y: 116.96 !!!!!!!!!end zoom!!!!!!! </code></pre>   i am beginning to suspect that i am losing track of the touch points because of cgaffintransformscale; however  i have not found anything online to suggest this to be an issue. any clues (including  read the documentation on xyz ) would be appreciated!    thanks in advance.,iphone

landscape orientation issue  i have my app 98% complete but stumbled across an issue which is stumping me! any help would be great.    basically....i have a 5 tab controller. i have done some remodelling on the first tab view so that moving it from portrait to landscape moves everything around so that it looks great. the other 4 tabs also move from portrait to landscape and back with ease.    now....the issue i stumbled across was that if i had say tab 5 in portrait  moved it to landscape and then tapped tab 1  the only bits in tab 1 that orientate to landscape are the bits i fixed in the sizing inspector. the bits i ve re-positioned in code won t landscape.    if i however turn that tab 1 portrait and then back to landscape  it works!    the label fields i ve moved with code using .frame and cgrectmake is in the    <pre><code>-(void)willanimaterotationtointerfaceorientation: (uiinterfaceorientation)interfaceorientation duration: (nstimeinterval)duration </code></pre>   method.    .......do i need to put some code in the appdelegate which the tabcontroller resides in      it makes sense to me that the tabbarcontroller knows the orientation.    when you tap a tab.....what method gets actioned first before the view loads      i think i need to catch the orientation then  adjust my label positions and then load the view.......    i would appreciate any thoughts     gaz.    <strong>edit:</strong> it s like what i want to do is be able to change things in tab 1 if the orientation changes in other tabs.can you do that  it seems that the 5 tab views are separate...,iphone

core data with uidocument: relationships of new objects somwhow broken after didenterbackground and reopen  i changed my app from a single context with sqlite store managed in the app delegate to uimanageddocument (like default xcode template with core data activated). now i have some strange behavior when trying to fetch objects that has been created since the current app startup  after i closed(backgrounded) and reopened the app.    there are 2 entities: folder and item. folder to item is a to-many-relationship.    the predicate of my fetchedresultscontroller to display the items in the current folder looks like that:   <pre><code>[fetchrequest setentity:[nsentitydescription entityforname:@ item  inmanagedobjectcontext:self.context]]; [fetchrequest setpredicate:[nspredicate predicatewithformat:@ (folder == %@)   self.currentfolder]];     </code></pre>   this still works fine beside one situation: - i create a new folder  add some items to it - then close (background) and reopen the app - select this folder to be displayed in the tableview then the fetch returns 0 results.    as soon as i kill the app and reopen it  the items of the folder are displayed again (and the fetchrequests returns the correct number of items).    i did some further testing inside the viewdidappear with some manual fetchrequests without a fetchedresultscontroller. and i really don t understand how this can happen.    both fetchrequests are basically the same (and also identical to the fetchedresultcontroller s one)  but the first one doesn t have the predicate and then checks in a for loop whether the item s folder ist the viewcontroller s currentfolder.    from my understanding  this should result in the exact same behavior  but while the predicate fails after backgrounding  the fetching of all items + testing in the for loop works fine all time.   <pre><code>// returns fetchresult.count = 0 for new created folders after backgrounding the app  [fetchrequest1 setentity:[nsentitydescription entityforname:@ item  inmanagedobjectcontext:self.context]]; [fetchrequest1 setpredicate:[nspredicate predicatewithformat:@ (folder == %@)   self.currentfolder]]; nsarray *fetchresult1 = [self.context executefetchrequest:fetchrequest1 error:nil];  // this time get all items in the context withour predicate [fetchrequest2 setentity:[nsentitydescription entityforname:@ item  inmanagedobjectcontext:self.context]]; [fetchrequest2 setpredicate:nil]; nsarray *fetchresult2 = [self.context executefetchrequest:fetchrequest1 error:nil];  // filter to get only the items in the current folder nsmutablearray *filteredfetchresults2 = [nsmutablearray mutablearraywithcapacity:0]; for (item *item in fetchresult2) {     if (item.folder == self.currentfolder) [filteredfetchresults2 addobject:item]; } // filteredfetchresults2 holds the correct items even after backgrounding. why !  </code></pre>   how could that be,iphone

in this case it is <code>cabasicanimation</code> on which <code>numberofsectionsintableview</code> is being called but sometimes there are class names like <code>nsmachport</code> which i have never

where do you add iphone frameworks from  i want to add the messageui framework to my project.    the first time i did it  i selected   <pre><code> /developer/platforms/iphoneos.platform/developer/sdks/iphoneos3.1sdk/system/library/frameworks/messageui.framework </code></pre>   after i did that my project would no longer build - lots of syntax errors  and wouldn t build even after i told xcode to delete the framework - still had syntax errors  just not quite as many.    so i went back to a back up of the project i d made just before doing the add - thank goodness i had one - and tried again.  this time i selected the messageui framework from   <pre><code> /developer/platforms/iphonesimulator.platform/developer/sdks/iphoneos3.1sdk/system/library/frameworks </code></pre>   now the project builds fine.    i also noticed there was a messageui framework in the folder   <pre><code> /developer/platforms/iphonesimulator.platform/developer/sdks/iphoneos3.0sdk/system/library/frameworks </code></pre>   why would i choose one over the other,iphone

iphone uitableview trigger a parent method   okay  so i m working on an iphone app with a preferences-esque section where there s a base tableview  which has one section  and several rows of customized cells to hold a name and a value label. clicking on a row brings up another view  which allows the user to pick from a list (another tableview)  and select an item.    all of these tableviews are done programatically. the base tableview has a property that holds a controller instance for each of the  pick from the list  views. each of the  pick from the list  views has a property called <code>chosenvalue</code> that has the currently-selected option. i ve gotten the ui to handle the <code>didselectrowatindexpath</code> to update the <code>chosenvalue</code> property and then  <code>pop</code>  the view (going back to the main tableview). but  even though the main tableview s <code>cellforrowatindexpath</code> method references the <code>chosenvalue</code> property of the subview that s held in a property  the view doesn t update when an item is selected. in short  how can the sub-view trigger a <code>reloaddata</code> on the parent object  after it  pops  and unloads,iphone

iphone sdk: pushviewcontroller crashing  i am having problems with getting a detail view to load using pushviewcontroller. at first  i thought pushviewcontroller was not working. but  then i tried using a different view controller and it worked. i can tell from tracing that the problem view controller is never loaded at all. in other words  i tried to eliminate the possibility that there was some error in the view controller by nsloging in that object and i never see anything.    does anyone have any ideas    <pre><code>- (void)tableview:(uitableview *)tableview  didselectrowatindexpath:(nsindexpath *)indexpath {  /*       nslog(@ hsitkjsdfkljlkd );      if (childcontroller == nil)         childcontroller = [[salesviewcontroller alloc] initwithnibname:@ salesview  bundle:nil];      //nsuinteger row = [indexpath row];      [self.navigationcontroller pushviewcontroller:childcontroller                                          animated:yes];   */  /*        //modal = blocking     salesviewcontroller *othervc = [[salesviewcontroller alloc] initwithnibname:@ salesview  bundle:nil];      //must set sale type     othervc.strsaletype = @ voice ;      [self presentmodalviewcontroller: othervc animated:yes];       //no close. by design  it is up to the othervc to close itself        */      //tipcalcviewcontroller *detailviewcontroller = [[tipcalcviewcontroller alloc] initwithnibname:@ tipcalcview  bundle:nil];     salesviewcontroller *detailviewcontroller = [[salesviewcontroller alloc] initwithnibname:@ salesview  bundle:nil];     // ...     // pass the selected object to the new view controller.

how hard is iphone/ipad development  i ve been developing for quite a while but while i consider myself competent (or better) with c++  java  c# &amp; as3/flex in areas from web-servers to desktop applications to 3d games  i m aware all these languages are pretty similar; even on the libraries side i know what to look for based on using libraries that do similar things in another language.    but objective c i understand to be a different kettle of fish  and developing for mobile devices has always struck me as likely to be hard work since you have to develop on your pc and test on the actual device itself - my experience developing for ps2 put me off such things due to poor debuggers and other tools.    what s the reality  is it a paradigm shift to move from web-servers and desktop apps and rich web-clients to iphone... or for an experienced developer is it just another language to learn and new libraries to play with  is there anything to be scared about at all     edit: my main question on obj-c specifically was if it s a different way of programming  like it would be moving to haskell from java for instance. it sounds this is not the case.,iphone

caching data before presenting popover  i have a main controller  and a popover that gets presented from the main controller.  my main controller passes an array to my popover.  in my viewdidload of my popover controller  i take that array  get the image and text data for that entry and put it into an nsdictionary.  i do this because i need to resize my pictures for my uitableview to be presented in the popover.  it works fine  however  since i now have an nsarray of nsdictionary in my popover  every time i bring up my popover  since this code is in the viewdidload  it gets created each time.  it seems like an expensive operation since there is a bit of lag in presenting the popover to begin with.  is there a way i can cache the data somewhere once it s loaded once   thanks.,iphone

subscription expiry date if user changes dates  our app uses non-renewable subscriptions to provide access to content for one year. the subscription receipt is stored on icloud (when available) and in the device keychain. there is also a ws that is called on occasion to validate the receipt but does not record the transaction.    our problem is if the users change their clock backwards (say set the date to 2010)  our subscription does not expire after one year but now three years (2013-2010).     our solution was to say that subscriptions with a duration of more than one year are fraudulent and the receipt is cleared and life goes on.    however  my boss now is complaining about users that set the clock to six months in the past (less than one year so ok  but the subscription lasts for 1.5 years instead of the valid one year).    is there a better way to be dealing with device clock tampering or is it something we have to live with (as i believe),iphone

event handling for ios - how hittest:withevent: and pointinside:withevent: are related   while most apple documents are very well written  i think  <a href= http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/eventhandling/conceptual/eventhandlingiphoneos/introduction/introduction.html  rel= noreferrer >event handling guide for ios</a>  is an exception. it s hard for me to clearly understand what s been described there.    the document says     <blockquote>    in hit-testing  a window calls <code>hittest:withevent:</code> on the top-most view of the view hierarchy; this method proceeds by recursively calling <code>pointinside:withevent:</code> on each view in the view hierarchy that returns yes  proceeding down the hierarchy until it finds the subview within whose bounds the touch took place. that view becomes the hit-test view.  </blockquote>   so is it like that only <code>hittest:withevent:</code> of the top-most view is called by the system  which calls <code>pointinside:withevent:</code> of all of subviews  and if the return from a specific subview is yes  then calls <code>pointinside:withevent:</code> of that subview s subclasses,iphone

wizard style navigation  dismissing a view and showing another one  i m making a set of screens similar to a wizard and i d like to know how to make a view dismiss itself and its parent view and immediately show a  donescreen  without worrying about resource leaks. my views look like the following:   <pre><code>base -&gt; level1 -&gt; donescreen                -&gt; level2 -&gt; donescreen </code></pre>   the level1 controller is a navigation controller created with a view.xib and shown with    <pre><code>[self presentmodalviewcontroller ...] </code></pre>   by the base controller. the level1 controller is also responsible for creating the  donescreen  which may be shown instead of the level2 screen based on a certain criteria.    when the user taps a button on the screen  the level1 controller instantiates the the level2 controller and it displays it via   <pre><code>[self.navigationcontroller pushviewcontroller ..] </code></pre>   and level2 controller s view has a  next  button.     when the use hits the  next  button in the level2 screen  i need to dismiss the current level2 s view as well as the level1 s view and display the  donescreen   which would have been created and passed in to the level2 controller from level1.

iphone - when is dealloc for a viewcontroller called   i am using uinavigationcontroller to move between views. when i move back and forth in views  the memory used by my app keeps on increasing. on placing nslog statements in the dealloc method of all viewcontrollers  i noticed it was being called for only some viewcontrollers and not all that were popped.    for instance  this is the sequence in which views are pushed mainviewcontroller -> viewcontroller1 -> viewcontroller2 -> viewcontroller3    now in viewcontroller3 if i do a poptoviewcontroller:maincontroller  dealloc is called only for viewcontroller3. it is not called for viewcontroller1 and 2.    can someone please tell me why this is happening.    <strong>found the problem. the dealloc method was not being called if any of the references held by a viewcontroller were still in memory. in my case it was the mpmovieplayercontroller object which was not released in viewcontroller1 and viewcontroller2.</strong>,iphone

how to scroll table view with toolbar at the top of the view  i have a view with a toolbar at the top and a table view with text fields in it s cells. when i want to edit the text fields placed in the bottom of the table view the keyboard is hiding the text field being edited (as the table view is not scrolled up).  i tried to implement <a href= http://cocoawithlove.com/2008/10/sliding-uitextfields-around-to-avoid.html  rel= nofollow noreferrer >http://cocoawithlove.com/2008/10/sliding-uitextfields-around-to-avoid.html</a> but this makes my whole view move up (the toolbar and the table view) while i would like to have the toobar at the top of the view for the whole time.  i modified the mentioned code to something like this:   <pre><code>- (void)textfielddidbeginediting:(uitextfield *)textfield {  cgrect textfieldrect = [tableview.window convertrect:textfield.bounds fromview:textfield]; cgrect viewrect = [tableview.window convertrect:tmptableview.bounds fromview:tableview];  cgfloat midline = textfieldrect.origin.y + 0.5 * textfieldrect.size.height; cgfloat numerator = midline - viewrect.origin.y - minimum_scroll_fraction * viewrect.size.height; cgfloat denominator = (maximum_scroll_fraction - minimum_scroll_fraction) * viewrect.size.height; cgfloat heightfraction = numerator / denominator;  if (heightfraction &lt; 0.0)  {     heightfraction = 0.0; } else if (heightfraction &gt; 1.0) {     heightfraction = 1.0; }  uiinterfaceorientation orientation = [[uiapplication sharedapplication] statusbarorientation]; if (orientation == uiinterfaceorientationportrait || orientation == uiinterfaceorientationportraitupsidedown) {     animateddistance = floor(portrait_keyboard_height * heightfraction); } else  {     animateddistance = floor(landscape_keyboard_height * heightfraction); }  cgrect viewframe = tableview.frame; viewframe.origin.y -= animateddistance;  [uiview beginanimations:nil context:null]; [uiview setanimationbeginsfromcurrentstate:yes]; [uiview setanimationduration:keyboard_animation_duration];  [tableview setframe:viewframe];  [uiview commitanimations];   } </code></pre>   and   <pre><code>- (void)textfielddidendediting:(uitextfield *)textfield { cgrect viewframe = tableview.frame; viewframe.origin.y += animateddistance;  [uiview beginanimations:nil context:null]; [uiview setanimationbeginsfromcurrentstate:yes]; [uiview setanimationduration:keyboard_animation_duration];  [tableview setframe:viewframe];  [uiview commitanimations]; } </code></pre>   this made my toolbar stay at the top  but unfortunately the table view overlays the toolbar and the toolbar is not visible.    any ideas how to solve this,iphone

limit number of characters in uitextfield where input is from ui  i have a uitextfield for which i get input from some buttons that are part of the ui (so the input does not come form the phone s virtual keyboard). i want to limit that number of characters. i tried using the <code>shouldchangecharactersinrange</code>  but it only works if the input comes form the virtual keyboard  and it doesn t work if the input comes from the buttons on the ui. is there anyway i can solve this without programmatically having to count the characters in the text field every time i want to update it     thank you  mihai fonoage,iphone

python redirect output to a file and console by opening new command prompt  i am trying to achieve a functionality where i can open a new command prompt and run some batch commands. then redirecting the output to a logfile and console on real time. so i am using wtee.exe (ex command: dir 2>&amp;1 | wtee.exe logfile.txt).    choosing popen over os.system because i need control over the new process (new command prompt)    as i wont be able to use pipe symbol in popen. i did the below functionality   <pre><code>newconsole = popen(       [ cmd   /v:on /k dir 2&gt;&amp;1 ]        creationflags=create_new_console stdout=pipe stderr=stdout       ) outputlog = popen(       [wtee.exe  logfile.txt ]        stdin=newconsole.stdout        ) </code></pre>   i can see the log file is generated and also the output in command prompt (on main window and not in new console).    so please help to find out the way how can i print the output in new console opened using subprocess.,python

designing a joint function  i have three functions  that each one of them calls internally the one below it:   <ul> <li>getbitrateoverhttp</li> <li>getfilesizeoverhttp</li> <li>is_serversupporthttprange</li> </ul>   each function uses an http request on it s own. which means the last function uses only a single http request  while the first uses three.    the <code>getbitrateoverhttp</code> function returns only the bitrate.    these functions work fine on their own  but now i want to get all the three outputs for a specific url.    i thought about:   <ol> <li>calling all the functions. the problem is that i ll make 6 http requests instead of 3.</li> <li>changing the definition of the functions to return others vars as well - but then it doesn t serve the basic purpose of the function - to return what it s meant to return. </li> <li>definite another function that doesn t use these definitions  but it doesn t seem smart to define again something that has been already coded.</li> </ol>   any help,python

python extract values of varying length from text files  i would like to load the contents of a .txt file as a string and extract a specific piece of information.  the information  which has lots of text before and after it s occurence  looks like this:   <pre><code>valuename:     1234 </code></pre>   but could also look like:   <pre><code>valuename:     123456 </code></pre>   that is to say  the value is always a string of integers  but of varying length.    i would like to find the  valuename  in the string  and return characters starting 6 characters afterwards.  my thought is to say check and see if the 10 characters starting 6 characters after the  valuename  are integers  and return them in order if they are.  is this possible   thanks kindly.,python
python create decorator preserving function arguments  i m trying to write a decorator that preserves the arguments of the functions it decorates. the motivation for doing this is to write a decorator that interacts nicely with <code>pytest.fixtures</code>.    suppose we have a function <code>foo</code>. it takes a single argument <code>a</code>.   <pre><code>def foo(a):     pass </code></pre>   if we get the argument spec of foo   <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; inspect.getargspec(foo) argspec(args=[ a ]  varargs=none  keywords=none  defaults=none) </code></pre>   we frequently want to create a decorator where the <code>wrapper</code> function passes all of its arguments verbatim to the <code>wrapped</code> function. the most obvious way to do this using <code>*args</code> and <code>**kwargs</code>  though  produces a function with a different argument spec.   <pre><code>def identity_decorator(wrapped):     def wrapper(*args  **kwargs):         return wrapped(*args  **kwargs)     return wrapper      def identity_decorator(wrapped):     def wrapper(*args  **kwargs):         return wrapped(*args  **kwargs)     return wrapper  @identity_decorator def foo(a):     pass </code></pre>   this  not surprisingly  produces a function with an argument spec reflecting the <code>*args</code> and <code>**kwargs</code>.   <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; inspect.getargspec(foo) argspec(args=[]  varargs= args   keywords= kwargs   defaults=none) </code></pre>   is there a way to either change the argument spec to match the wrapped function or create the function with the right argument spec initially,python

python find method in strings seems to be failing  i have a text file like so: <a href= http://pastie.org/10309944  rel= nofollow >http://pastie.org/10309944</a>    this contains numbers corresponding to lists of edi segments that could possibly be associated with them. my goal is to write a script that takes in one of these codes (the numbers) as input and outputs the corresponding lists. the lists are surrounded by  -  characters to make the parsing easier.     i wrote the following code: `class segmentsusedfinder(object):        finds a transaction code and returns the possible segments used.           <pre><code>def __init__(self  transaction_code):        initializes the segment finder.      args:         transaction_code: the transaction code to find possible segments from.             self._transaction_code = transaction_code +   -   def find_segment(self):        finds the possible segments that correspond to the        transaction code.             fileobject = open( transactioncodes.txt    r )     data =        for line in fileobject:         line = line.rstrip( \n ).rstrip()         data += line     fileobject.close()      position = data.find(self._transaction_code) + len(self._transaction_code)       with open( transactioncodes.txt    r ) as file:         file.seek(position)         segments =            char =            while true:             char = file.read(1)             if char ==  - :                 break             segments += char      return segments </code></pre>   i then create a finder object like so:   <pre><code>finder = segmentsusedfinder( 270 ) print finder.find_segment() </code></pre>   this code actually works but when i adjust the string inside the segmentsusedfinder constructor to 271 or 837 it fails for some reason. i think i m perhaps misusing the find method  but it works for the first instance. i can also get it to work for 271 if i add 2 to position and to work for 837 if i add 4 to position.     any help would be greatly appreciated  thanks.,python
python does not warn about variable re-declaration  i just spent a whole day tracking down this bug:   <pre> for idx  val in enumerate(some_list):     for idx  otherval in enumerate(another_list): #the idx for the outer loop is overwritten         #blah blah </pre>   coming from a strongly typed language background  i got bitten hard by this. in strongly typed languages i would get an error about variable re-declaration. i don t know why the interpreter doesn t issue a warning for this  and the design decision behind this. this is obviously a bug  i mean  what could possibly be the legit use of this construct  is there any option to enable this sort of check  thanks.,python

python: submitting different jobs to different cpus  i have a fortran <code>atoms.out</code> file that performs some function. i am calling that fortran file from within python with:   <pre><code>values = subprocess.popen([ ./atoms.out    ./%s.klj  % test1   ./%s.out  % test1]  stdout = subprocess.pipe) </code></pre>   i ve looked at <a href= http://www.parallelpython.com/content/view/15/30/  rel= nofollow >python pp</a>  but i dont think it is what i am looking for  as it uses n number of cpus for a single job.    the calculations conducted by the fortran file are not independent and cannot be used with <code>python pp</code>    so my question is how can i submit a number of jobs to a number of different cpus  say for example i have: 7 files that i want to be run over 4 cpus.    so each job is distributed as:   <pre><code>file1 -&gt; cpu1 file2 -&gt; cpu2 file3 -&gt; cpu3 file4 -&gt; cpu4 </code></pre>   then when a job has finished on a cpu it is replaces with the remaining 3 files to run. say <code>file1</code> is finished on <code>cpu1</code> it is replaced by <code>file5</code>  so the distribution of jobs would look like:   <pre><code>file5 -&gt; cpu1 file2 -&gt; cpu2 file3 -&gt; cpu3 file4 -&gt; cpu4 </code></pre>   and so forth until it has finished running the fortran file on the 7 files.,python

printing text in form of circle  i m trying to form figures of the text a person chooses.  i already made a square  pyramid and a parallelogram.     where i get stuck is when i m trying to make a circle. my thought was to use a <code>for i in range (1  height/2)</code> where it would print the text (f.e. --) * i times. then i wanted another for loop to print the exact opposite  so from <code>height/2</code> to <code>height</code>  it should first print <code>height/2*</code> text en for every time the for loop starts again  it should print the text one time less.    i m not completely sure if this will look like a circle somehow.  i ll give my code for a pyramid and a circle. i m aware that for the circle  i still need to do something with <code>   </code>  but as i don t really know how to get everything working in the first place  i haven t began thinking about how i m gonna need blank spaces in that code.   <pre><code>def print_pyramid(height):     text = raw_input( please give in what your pyramid needs to be formed from  you can choose two **  two --  or two letters )     for i in range(1 height+1):          print (height-i+1)*     text * i  def print_circle(height):     text = raw_input( give in what your circle is made of: **  -- or two letters. )     for i in range(1 height/2):         print text*i     for j in range ((height/2)-1 (height/2)+1):         print text*j     for h in range((height/2)+2  height+1):         print text*((height/2)-h) </code></pre>   <a href= http://i.stack.imgur.com/bqif8.jpg  rel= nofollow >example of output  see link</a>,python
open file for random write without truncating   in python  there are a few flags you can supply when opening a file for operation. i am a bit baffled at finding a combination that allow me to do <strong>random write without truncating</strong>. the behavior i am looking for is equivalent to c: create it if it doesn t exist  otherwise  open for write (not truncating)    <code>open(filename  o_wronly|o_creat)</code>    python s <a href= https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/io.html#module-io >document</a> is confusing (to me): <code> w </code> will truncate the file first  <code> + </code> is supposed to mean updating  but <code> w+ </code> will truncate it anyway. is there anyway to achieve this without resorting to the low-level <code>os.open()</code> interface     note: the <code> a </code> or <code> a+ </code> doesn t work either (please correct if i am doing something wrong here)   <pre><code>cat test.txt eee  with open( test.txt    a+ ) as f:   f.seek(0)   f.write( a ) cat test.txt eeea </code></pre>   is that so the append mode insist on writing to the end,python

importing module in another module  my question is simple. if i import  let s say  numpy in a module called foo.py  and i imported foo.py in a script that has numpy imported  would numpy be imported twice  in other words  would a module be imported twice in the same script  i care because importing scipy (for example) multiple times (if it s true) is memory inefficient.,python

sorting based on a variable number of sort keys input after execution  i am very new to python and my apologies is this has already been answered.  i can see a lot of previous answers to  sort  questions but my problem seems a little different from these questions and answers.    i have a list of keys  with each key contained in a tuple  that i am trying to sort.  each key is derived from a subset of the columns in a csv file  but this subset is determined by the user at runtime and can t be hard coded as it will vary from execution to execution.  i also have a datetime value that will always form part of the key as the last item in the tuple (so there will be at least one item to sort on - even if the user provides no additional items).    the tuples to be sorted look like:   <pre><code>(col0  col1  .... coln  datetime) </code></pre>   where col0 to coln are based on the values found in columns in a csv file  and the  n  can change from run to run.      in each execution  the tuples in the list will always have the same number of items in each tuple.  however  they need to be able to vary from run to run based on user input.    the sort looks like:    <pre><code>sorted(concurrencydict.keys()  key=itemgetter(0  1  2)) </code></pre>   ... when i do hard-code the sort based on the first three columns.  the issue is that i don t know in advance of execution that 3 items will need to be sorted - it may be 1  2  3 or more.      i hope this description makes sense.    i haven t been able to think of how i can get itemgetter to accept a variable number of values.    does anyone know whether there is an elegant way of performing a sort based on a variable number of items in python where the number of sort items is determined at run time (and not based on fixed column numbers or attribute names),python

i change python code  but python doesn t seem to read the changes  so  i ve been programming in python and i ve run into this really annoying issue.  i wrote a small matrix library and started using it in another module (eg  import matrixlib).  i d find a bug  fix it and run the program again.  bug still there.      i d throw in a few print statements to see what s going on  but they wouldn t print.  i eventually figured out that my changes weren t registering with python.  so i started deleting .pyc files (precompiled python) but that didn t help.      i eventually gave up and just started programming straight from the matrix lib file  but now that issue has come back.  i threw in a print statement to figure out what was going on with a method  fixed the issue  and took it out.  but it still prints.  i even did a search for  print  in a different text editor than idle  but found only not a single print statement in the code.      this isn t really a code issue per say  i ve probably mucked up my python install somehow.  (this only happens on my windows box  not my linux box).  if you want to see the code anyway  feel free.  the hiesenbug-print statement is commented out in my code  yet still executes.   <pre><code>    def det(self):         #had better be a square matrix.         if self.colcount() != self.rowcount():             return none         #are we a 1x1 matrix          if self.colcount() == self.rowcount() == 1:             return self.a[0][0]         #are we a 2x2 matrix          if self.colcount() == self.rowcount() == 2:             return self.a[0][0]*self.a[1][1]-self.a[1][0]*self.a[0][1]         #not a 2x2... so lets start recursing.         d = 0         for e in range(0 self.colcount()):             tmp = partition(self.a  0  e)             if e%2 == 0:                 d = d + self.a[0][e]*self.detrecursive(tmp)             else:                 d = d - self.a[0][e]*self.detrecursive(tmp)         #print d         return d      def detrecursive(self  matrix):         m = matrix()         m.setmatrix(matrix)          return m.det()      def partition(a  r  c):         out = []         for row in range(0  len(a)):             if r != row:                 out.append([])                 for col in range(0  len(a[0])):                     if col != c:                         out[-1].append(a[row][col])         return out </code></pre>,python

python - why cmp( ) is useful   according to the <a href= http://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#cmp  rel= noreferrer >doc</a> and this <a href= http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/number_cmp.htm  rel= noreferrer >tutorial</a>     <code>cmp() returns -1 if x &lt; y</code>     and     <code>cmp() returns 0 if  x == y</code>     and     <code>cmp() returns 1 if  x &gt; y</code>     the tutorial also said that   <blockquote>    cmp() returns the sign of the difference of two numbers  </blockquote>   i don t really get what does it mean <em>sign of the difference of two numbers</em>. doesn t that mean that it returns a value when the sign of number aren t equal ( positive and negative sign )   since...   <pre><code>cmp(80  100) :  -1      # both have positive sign. cmp(180  100) :  1      # both also have positive sign. cmp(-80  100) :  -1 cmp(80  -100) :  1 </code></pre>   **note: code from the tutorial.*    despite my confusion in sign differences  i can t really think of why do we need a built-in function to return a value of -1 when x &lt; y.     isn t the function <strong><code>cmp( )</code></strong> easily implemented   is there any reason why python creators keep <code>cmp( )</code> function  or is there any hidden usage of this python s <strong><code>cmp( )</code></strong> function,python

python time function inconsistency  i ve been gave an assignment were i had to create two small functions that gives  with equal chance   heads  or  tails  and  similary with a 6 faces thrown dice  1 2 3 4 5 or 6.    important: i could not use randint or similar functions for this assignment.    so i ve created those two functions that generate a  pseudo-random number  utilizing time (first digit of the milliseconds) function from python library:   <pre><code>import time  def dice():     ctrl = false     while ctrl == false:             m = lambda: int(round(time.time() * 1000))             f = m()             d = abs(f) % 10             if d in range(1 7):                     return d                     ctrl = true   def coin():         m = lambda: int(round(time.time() * 1000))         f = m()         if f % 2 == 0:                 return  tails          elif f == 0:                 return  tails          else:                 return  heads  (edit: i don t know why i typed  dimes  before) </code></pre>   however i ve observed a tendency to give  tails  over  heads   so i ve created an function to test the percentage of  tails  and  heads  in 100 throws:   <pre><code>def _test():     ta = 0     he = 0     x = 100     while x &gt; 0:         c = coin()         if c ==  tails :             ta += 1         else:             he += 1     x -= 1     time.sleep(0.001) print( tails:%s heads:%s  % (ta  he)) </code></pre>   the result of the test was (for several times):   <pre><code>tails:56 heads:44 </code></pre>   so i did the same thing with the dice function and the result was:   <pre><code>1:20 2:20 3:10 4:20 5:10 6:20 </code></pre>   so  as you can see  for some reason i could not infer - if it is by some mistake of my or some other reason - the time function has a tendency to give less  3  and  5   and running the test again with all the numbers (zeros  sevens  eights and nines included) i ve come to see that this tendency extends to  0  and  7 .    i would be grateful for some insight and opinions on the matter.    edit:    remove the round() function from the <code>m = lambda: int(round(time.time() * 1000))</code> function solved the problem - as answered by makoto.,python
send a variable from outside the python console or stop a script from outside  i wrote a python script that executes an optimization and runs days to get a solution (due to the costly objective function). in all days work it will be sufficient to just stop the calculation at some point because the solution is good enough for me (but not for the optimization algorithm).    the problem is  i can always abort hitting ctrl+c. but then there is no chance to nicely output the current best parameters  plot the data  save it etc. it would be great to stop the script in a controlled way after the next calculation of the objective function. so my thought was so question some variable (if user_stop=true) and programatically stop the optimization. but how to set such a variable  the python console is blocked during execution.    i thought about setting the content of a text file and reading it in each iteration but it s more than poor and hard to explain for other users of the script. theoretically  i could also ask the user for an input but than the script won t run automatically (which it should until someone decides to stop).    any ideas for my problem     basically that s it - stop the loop at some point but execute the print:   <pre><code>a = 0 while true:     a = a + 1 print(a) </code></pre>,python
reading file and creating dictionary based on delimiters  i have a file that has several lines consisting of items. the structure is a class  followed by a category  followed by prerequisites in the class.   <pre><code>#class  category  pre-requisites(amount of them can change)  math 2430  preprofessional  math 2429|math 2428  math 2431  professional  math 2430|math 2429|math 2428  </code></pre>   what i want to end up having is a dictionary with the class as a key  then the category and prerequisites as the values in a list. something like    <pre><code>{ math 2430  : [ preprofessional    math 2429   math 2428 ]...... } </code></pre>   the vertical bar is an indicator of oncoming prerequisite classes.the problem im running into is that the number or vertical bar delimiters may vary so the pre prequisite classes may vary by line. so im not sure how to split based on how many vertical bars there are   <pre><code>i wrote  zdic = {} pre_req = file.count( | ) # to count how many vertical bars appear if  |  in file : prereq = pre_req for line in file :     course  category  prereq1(depending on bars...) = split( \w+  file) </code></pre>   how do i deal with the fact that the number of pre requisite classes may vary  and depending on how many there are  split accordingly to manipulate and enter into a dixtionary,python

python - saving arima forecast data to file  hi and thanks in advance     so i m trying to write my forecast data to a file from my plot which is using an arima forecast. how would i be able to do so  so that i could access the saved forecast data later     here is my code:    <pre><code>import pandas from matplotlib import pyplot  series = pandas.read_csv( quantity.csv  header=0 parse_dates=[0]) series.columns = [ date   quantity ] series.set_index([ date ] inplace=true)  model = arima(series[ quantity ].astype(float)  order=(2 0 1))  fittedmodel = model.fit(disp=0 method= css )  stepsahead = 10  forecastarray = fittedmodel.forecast(steps=stepsahead) for i in range(stepsahead):     series.loc[len(series)] = forecastarray[0][i]  series.plot()  pyplot.show() </code></pre>   here is the data i used to plot with if needed:   <pre><code>date    quantity 2010/01/01  1358 2010/07/02  0 2010/08/03  0 2011/02/04  0 2011/11/05  0 2011/12/06  274 2012/06/07  1074 2012/08/30  2223 2013/04/16  0 2013/03/18  1753 2014/02/22  345 2014/01/27  24 2015/12/15  652 2015/09/28  275 2016/05/04  124 2017/11/07  75 2017/09/22  32 2017/04/04  12 </code></pre>   thank you.,python
how to capture the screen output of a running program   is it possible to take screenshots of a running program (with gui) from another python program   if so  what could be the steps and libraries that i could use   (on windows)    for example  let s say i have calc.exe running. i d want to take screenshots of what is displayed to the user from myprogram.py.     my goal is to analyze what s displayed on the monitored program.     if it s not possible to isolate the screenshot to a running predefined program  i think i will have to take screenshots of the fullscreen but it s not very practical.,python
how to tell if a sequence in python is mutable or not   for built-in python types  <code>list</code> is mutable but <code>tuple</code> is not. for other sequences  is there a way to tell whether they are mutable or not  like a mutable sequence usually has <code>.pop()</code>  <code>.insert()</code>  or <code>.extend()</code> member function  do all mutable sequences and immutable sequences inherit from separate built-in types  which then can be used to differentiate them,python

how to take specific letters off a string  i am having difficulty creating a function that removes letters of  t  in two different ways. the <code>parameter</code> is a <code>boolean</code>  if the parameter is <code>true</code> then it will print out a userinput (that is written in my code below) and it will keep asking that same input until the person types in  quit  and when the user does type in  quit  then it will take off all lower case  t  inside the string. if the <code>boolean</code> is <code>false</code>  then the same process applies but instead of it taking out a lower case  t  it will take off a capital  t . also  i want to keep the same type of format i written in my code below  thanks. btw i am using python 2.4.   <blockquote> <pre><code>def removet(boolea):     userinput=str(input( enter a word/sentence you want to process:  ))     while userinput:         string = (raw_input( enter a word/sentence you want to process: ))         if boolea == false:             userinput = userinput + string             while  t  in userinput:                 index = userinput.find( t )                 userinput = userinput[:index] + userinput[index+1:]         if string ==  quit :             keepasking = false             return userinput          else:             userinput = userinput + string             while  t  in userinput:                 index = userinput.find( t )                 userinput = userinput[:index] + userinput[index+1:]             while  t  in userinput:                 index = userinput.find( t )                 userinput = userinput[:index] + userinput[index+1:] </code></pre> </blockquote>,python
how do i override imbedded function/definition values in python  i apologize in advance if the terminology in my question is incorrect. i want to find out if it s possible to override a variable that is hidden deep in a bunch of consecutive class calls that you don t have direct access too  but would still effect the outcome.    here is an example i ve tried to write that will hopefully make my question more clear.    i have 3 python modules  test1.py  test2.py and test3.py. each module has a class and some definitions. test2.py is where the code is run from.    test1.py   <pre><code>class a(object):     def __init__(self  value=5):         self.a = value     def foo(self  value3 = 7  value4 = 5):         from test3 import d         c = self.a + value3 + value4         d = d()         e = d.b()         f = c + e         return f  class b(object):     def __init__(self  value = 1):         self.d = value         object1 = a(self.d)         self.fooreturn = object1.foo()     def bar(self  value2 = 3):         f = value2         g = self.fooreturn + self.d + f         return g </code></pre>   test3.py   <pre><code>class d(object):     def __init__(self  value=6  wanted_value=9):         self.value = value + wanted_value     def a(self  value3 = 4):         self.value3 = value3 * 2         return self.value3     def b(self  value4 = 5):         valuex = self.a()         value5 = value4 + self.value + valuex         return value5 </code></pre>   test2.py   <pre><code>from test1 import b  if __name__ ==  __main__ :     test = b(4)     result = test.bar()     print result </code></pre>   returns a value of:-   <pre><code>55 </code></pre>   i m sorry it looks so convoluted  it s my way of trying to make a value look out of normal reach :)    basically what i would like to do is find out how to redefine the value of  wanted_value  in the test3.py  class d  <strong>init</strong> def  while not changing the  if  in test2.py.   <pre><code>if __name__ ==  __main__ :     test = b(4)     result = test.bar()     print result </code></pre>   one way i can see might be possible would be to redefine the class d definition in test2.py and redirect any call to the original class d to the modified one using a global variable.    e.g.    test2.py   <pre><code>from test1 import b from test3 import d  class dx(d):     # add the value i want to use to  wanted_value      def __init__(self  value=6  wanted_value=3):         self.value = value + wanted_value  # create a global d.__init__ = dx.__init__  if __name__ ==  __main__ :     test = b(4)     result = test.bar()     print result </code></pre>   this errors saying  unbound method_<em>init</em>_() must be called with dx instance as first arguement.    so it s obviously incorrect  but if these is a way to make it work with out having to redefine the whole of class d     any help would be great. it may be obvious that my knowledge of inheritance is not too crash hot :)    thanks.,python
comparing file contents in python  i have two files  say source and target. i compare each element in source to check if it also exists in target. if it does not exist in target  i print it ( the end goal is to have 0 difference). here is the code i have written.   <pre> def finddefaulters(source target):   f = open(source  r )   g = open(target  r )    reference = f.readlines()   done = g.readlines()   for i in reference:     if i not in done:       print i  </pre>   i need help with   <ol> <li>how would this code be rated on a scale of 1-10</li> <li>how can i make it better and optimal if the file sizes are huge.</li> </ol>   another question - when i read all the lines as list elements  they are interpreted as  element\n  - so for correct comparison  i have to add a newline at the end of each file. is there a way to strip the newlines so i do not have to add newline at the end of files. i tried rstrip. but it did not work. thanks in advance.,python

what s the difference between hasattr() and  attribute  in dir()   for example:   <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; s =  string  &gt;&gt;&gt; hasattr(s   join ) true &gt;&gt;&gt;  join  in dir(s) true </code></pre>   <a href= http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#hasattr  rel= nofollow >python documentation</a> says that <code>hasattr</code> is implemented calling <code>getattr</code> and seeing whether it raises an exception or not. however  that leads to a great overhead  since the value obtained is discarded and an exception may be raised.    the question is if calling <code> attribute  in dir(obj)</code> means the same thing  is it faster  safe  or may it fail in a particular occasion,python

find the most restrictive data type to which a string can be cast (python)  i want to read text files such as csv  or tab-separated values  but only columns which can be cast to numbers. for instance  if a column contains only strings  i d like not to read it. this is because i d like to avoid working with numpy arrays of multiple data types (i would be interested to know why i should  however questions should not be subject to discussion).    various questions were quite close to mine (see <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3098337/method-for-guessing-type-of-data-represented-currently-represented-as-strings >1</a>  <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/379906/parse-string-to-float-or-int >2</a> and <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/642154/how-to-convert-strings-into-integers-in-python >3</a>). however  apart from <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3098337/method-for-guessing-type-of-data-represented-currently-represented-as-strings >1</a>  they focus on converting the string rather than check which data type it could be converted to  which is why i mostly followed <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3098337/method-for-guessing-type-of-data-represented-currently-represented-as-strings >1</a> to obtain the desired result.    <a href= https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.genfromtxt.html  rel= nofollow noreferrer >numpy s genfromtxt</a> already does something close (by using the  dtype  argument). i suppose i could use this (with  dtype  set to none)  and then just checking each column s data type.    here s what i have so far:   <pre><code>def data_type(string_to_test):     checks to which data type a string can be cast. the main goal is to convert strings to floats. the hierarchy for upcasting goes like this: int-&gt;float-&gt;complex-&gt;string. thus  int is the most restrictive. :param string_to_test: a string of character that hypothetically represents a number :return: the most restrictive data type to which the string could be cast.     # do this to convert also floats that use coma instead of dots: string_to_test = string_to_test.replace(      . ) # first  try to switch from string to int: try:     # this will yield true if string_to_test represents an int  or a float that is equal to an int (e.g.:  1.0 ).     if int(float(string_to_test)) == float(string_to_test):         return int     else:         int(string_to_test)         return float except valueerror:     # if it doesn t work  try switching from string to float:     try:         float(string_to_test)         return float     except valueerror:         # happens with complex numbers and types (e.g.: float(4 + 3j)  or float(float64)).         # if this still doesn t work  try switching from string to complex:         try:             # make sure spaces between operators don t cause any problems (e.g.:  1 + 4j  will not work              # while  1+4j  will).             complex(string_to_test.replace(       ))             return complex         # if none of the above worked  the string is said not to represent any other data types  (remember this         # function is supposed to be used on data that is read from files  so checking only for those types should         #  be exhaustive enough).         except valueerror:             return str </code></pre>   my biggest problem with this is that i find it rather ugly  and also that there could be cases i haven t thought about. thus my question is  could it be done in a better way  .    also  i m interested to know when would it be better to return strings representing that data type  instead of the class itself (e.g.: return  complex  as a string instead of complex  the class). for instance  i know i can use both (the string or the class) when using the method <a href= https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.astype.html  rel= nofollow noreferrer >astype</a> for numpy arrays.    thanks in advance!,python

python: how to get all of the local variables defined in another module  is there a way to get a reference to the local variables defined in a different module     for example  i have two files: framework.py and user_code.py:    <strong>framework.py:</strong>   <pre><code>from kivy.app import app  class base_a:     pass  class myapp(app):     def on_start(self):            here i d like to get a reference to sub-classes of base_a and         instantiated objects of these sub-classes  defined in the file          user_code.py  such as a1  a2  as well as the class a itself          without explicitly passing them to myapp s instance.             </code></pre>   <strong>user_code.py:</strong>   <pre><code>from framework import myapp  class a(base_a):     pass  app = myapp() a1 = a() a2 = a()  app.run() </code></pre>   what i d like to do is to somehow get a reference to the objects <strong>a1</strong> and <strong>a2</strong>  as well as the class <strong>a</strong>  that were all defined in <strong>user_code.py</strong>. i d like to use them in the method <strong>on_start</strong>  which is invoked in <strong>app.run()</strong>.    is it possible  for example  to get a reference to the scope in which the myapp object was defined (user_code.py)     <strong>some background for anyone who s interested:</strong>    i know it s a bit of an odd question  but the reason is:    i m writing a python framework for creating custom-made gui control programs for self-made instruments  based on arduino. it s called <a href= http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/scs/chimia/2015/00000069/00000004/art00003 crawler=true  rel= nofollow >instrumentino</a> (sitting in <a href= https://github.com/yoelk/instrumentino  rel= nofollow >github</a>) and i m currently developing version 2.    for people to use the framework  they need to define a system description file (<strong>user_code.py</strong> in the example) where they declare what parts they re using in their system (python objects)  as well as what type of actions the system should perform (python classes).    what i m trying to achieve is to automatically identify these objects and classes in myapp s <strong>on_start</strong> without asking the user to explicitly pass these objects and classes  in order to make the user code cleaner. meaning to avoid code such as:   <pre><code>app.add_object(a1) app.add_object(a2) app.add_class(a) </code></pre>,python

properly resolving import errors with directories  my question here is more about the appropriate way to resolve import errors in a way that is considered  pythonically correct   if there is such a term. i thought i had solution to my problem (posted below and updated)  but even that turns out not work.    <strong>context</strong>    i have looked at various responses to this (like <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30456068/how-to-resolve-import-errors-in-python >how to resolve import errors in python </a>) and i think i ve done those things  but i still have the question that i m posting here.    <strong>example</strong>    i have the following structure:   <pre><code>pacumen   rules     __init__.py     pacman_rules.py   pacman.py   game.py </code></pre>   in <code>pacman_rules.py</code> i have a class:   <pre><code>class pacmanrules:     .... </code></pre>   in my <code>pacman.py</code> file  i have the following import statement:   <pre><code>from rules.pacman_rules import pacmanrules </code></pre>   mind you  this was auto-generated by pycharm. so pycharm shows me that it resolves just fine.    however  when i run <code>pacman.py</code> from the command line  i get the following error:   <pre><code>importerror: cannot import name pacmanrules </code></pre>   i have no idea why that s happening in this case  given the lines of code.    in <code>pacman.py</code> i also have this statement:   <pre><code>from game import gamestatedata </code></pre>   that one is working just fine. notice that the class <code>gamestatedata</code> comes from my <code>game.py</code> file. so i m guessing my issue is that i m trying to import from a file in a different directory rather than from a file in the same directory.    <strong>possible solution (update: does not work)</strong>    so then i tried this import instead:   <pre><code>from rules import pacman_rules </code></pre>   that seems to work  but it requires me to change lines like this:   <pre><code>pacmanrules.getlegalactions(self) </code></pre>   to lines like this:   <pre><code>pacman_rules.pacmanrules.getlegalactions(self) </code></pre>   that just feels messy to me and seems to defeat the purpose of importing a class name so i can use it without having to preface it.    but  as it turns out  this doesn t work either. this just gets a different error:   <pre><code>importerror: cannot import name pacman_rules </code></pre>   so that s my question here. most questions seem to revolve around <em>how</em> to fix the issue; as it turns out i don t even have a  fix.     what i m curious about is why the initial approach doesn t work (especially since pycharm generates it) and if my proposed solution is the appropriate way to handle this.,python
access the name of a list in a python print statement  i am running python 3.6 and pandas 0.19.2 and want to access the name of a list as follows:   <pre><code># work on the following two lists for list in [list1  list2]:      # loop through items in each list     for entry in bucket_set:          # do stuff     # let user know i finished working on list x     print( i just finished working on:  +list) </code></pre>   in the first iteration  this should do stuff and then print out:  i just finished working on list1 . however: when i run my code  i get the following error:    <pre><code>typeerror: must be str  not list </code></pre>   this makes perfect sense (a list is not a string after all)  but <strong>is there any way i can get the name of my list as a string ( list1 ) </strong> i know i can use a dict instead (which is what i m doing right now)  but i m interested nonetheless.,python

trouble isolating emails when downloading via python script  i have a script that fetches emails from my account  downloads the attachments  creates some html for an email blast program  and then zips them into a nice little archive. this works well when only one email is present in the inbox  however  the script hangs when multiple emails exist. i feel like this is because the section of the script that zips the files is not looping correctly. what i am trying to accomplish is one zip file for each email. 3 emails in the inbox = 3 seperate zip files. i ve done my best to reduce my code for maximum readability while still maintaining the core structure. could anyone point me in the right direction here  thanks!    code:   <pre><code>for emailid in items:     resp  data = m.fetch(emailid   (rfc822) )     email_body = data[0][1]     mail = email.message_from_string(email_body)      for part in mail.walk():         if part.get_content_type() ==  text/plain :             content = part.get_payload()             #do something/define variables from email contents                 if mail.get_content_maintype() !=  multipart :         continue      for part in mail.walk():         if part.get_content_maintype() ==  multipart :             continue          if part.get( content-disposition ) is none:             continue          filename = part.get_filename()         counter = 1          if not filename:             filename =  part-%03d%s  % (counter   bin )             counter += 1          att_path = os.path.join(detach_dir  filename)          if not os.path.isfile(att_path) :             fp = open(att_path   wb )             fp.write(part.get_payload(decode=true))             fp.close()      path =  c:\directory      os.chdir(path)     for file in os.listdir( . ):         #download attachments     htmlfile = str(token)+ .html      htmlcode = ( &lt;html&gt;html goes here&lt;/html&gt; )     htmldata = open(os.path.join( c:\directory   htmlfile)   w+ )     htmldata.write(htmlcode)     print htmlfile+  complete      htmldata.close()     allfiles = [f for f in os.listdir( . )]     for file in allfiles:         archive = zipfile.zipfile(token+ .zip   mode= a )         archive.write(file)         archive.close()         os.unlink(file) </code></pre>   <strong>update</strong>    here is alink to the complete code. <a href= http://ideone.com/wexv9p  rel= nofollow >http://ideone.com/wexv9p</a>,python

python programming string handling  for an expression with parentheses  we can define the nesting depth as the maximum number of parentheses that are open when reading the expression from left to right. for instance  the nesting depth of  (33+77)(44-12)  is 1  while the nesting depth of  (a(b+c)-d)(e+f)  is 2.    write a python function depth(s) that takes a string containing an expression with parentheses and returns an integer  the nesting depth of s. you can assume that s is well-parenthesized: that is  that is  every  (  has a matching  )  after it and every  )  has a matching  (  before it.    here are some examples to show how your function should work.   <pre><code>depth( 22 ) 0 depth( (a+b)(a-b) ) 1 depth( (a(b+c)-d)(e+f) ) 2 </code></pre>   this is what i tried   <pre><code>def depth(s):     count i=0 0;     while i&lt;=len(s):         if s[i]== ( :             count=count+1;         if s[i]== ) :             return count         i=i+1;     return count      #this is what i tried. </code></pre>,python

why is the python index function execution time faster than my own linear search function   i m doing an experiment comparing the execution time of the index function and my own linear search function. to my understanding  python implements a linear search algorithm for the index function so the execution time should be roughly the same  shouldn t it     my own search function looks like this   <pre><code>def linearsearch (x numlist length):           n = 0     for i in range(length):             n = n + 1             if numlist[i] == x:                     return i  n     return -1  n </code></pre>,python
python get all intermediate values from a transition  is there away to transition between 2 values in python  something like:     transition(1 15)    this will run a loop returning all intermediate values (1 2 3 4 5....). sorry for the very basic question..,python
python - sending multiple values for one argument to a function  i am a few days new to python so if this is silly please excuse me..    is there a method to sending multiple variables to a single function  as an example:   <pre><code>pe.plot_chart(conn 7760  datasource1  123 save=true) </code></pre>   this above function takes a connection to sql where it pulls data for unique id 7760 from datasource1 (uniqueid 123). can i use some method to send multiple criteria for the datasource1 field  e.g.   <pre><code>pe.plot_chart(conn 7760 [ datasource1   datasource2 ] [123 345] save=true) </code></pre>   pe.plot_chart was created by me  so any modifications that have to be made to it to make it work are fine    is this type of operation possible to perform     edit: adding on some extra info.    the plot_chart function.. well it plots a chart  and saves it to the location above. each call of the function produces one graph  i was hoping that by sending multiple values for a parameter i could have the function dynamically add more series to the plot.    so if i send 4 data sources to the function  i will end up with 4 lines on the plot. for this reason i am not sure looping through a data source collection would be good (will just produce 4 plots with one line ),python
how to return stdout of a python function at regular intervals   i m calling several functions from one main function mainfunc (which is exposed as restful service using flask module). execution may take few minutes to an hour to complete and requirement is to display progress (output of functions being called) every 30 seconds. as rest api calls are made from another program to mainfunc() so it should return the output (i.e current status) at each call.    i tried yield and stringio as per <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16571150/how-to-capture-stdout-output-from-a-python-function-call >how to capture stdout output from a python function call </a> but could not make it work  stdout is returned only on completion of all tasks and not in between. please suggest if this can be done.   <pre><code>mainfunc():     runs_for_5_mins()     runs_for_30_mins()       ...     return output </code></pre>,python
extending base classes in python  i m trying to extend some  base  classes in python:   <pre><code>class xlist (list):     def len(self):         return len(self)      def add(self  *args):         self.extend(args)         return none   class xint (int):     def add(self  value):         self += value         return self   x = xlist([1 2 3]) print x.len()   ## &gt;&gt;&gt; 3 ok print x         ## &gt;&gt;&gt; [1 2 3] ok x.add (4  5  6) print x         ## &gt;&gt;&gt; [1 2 3 4 5 6] ok  x = xint(10) print x         ## &gt;&gt;&gt; 10 ok x.add (2) print x         ## &gt;&gt;&gt; 10  # not ok (#1)  print type(x)         ## &gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;class  __main__.xint &gt; ok x += 5 print type(x)         ## &gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;type  int &gt;  # not ok (#2) </code></pre>   it works fine in the <em>list</em> case because the <em>append</em> method modifies the object  in place   without returning it. but in the <em>int</em> case  the <em>add</em> method doesn t modify the value of the external <em>x</em> variable. i suppose that s fine in the sense that <em>self</em> is a local variable in the <em>add</em> method of the class  but this is preventing me from modifying the initial value assigned to the instance of the class.    is it possible to extend a class this way or should i define a class property with the base type and map all the needed methods to this property,python

condense this python statement without destroying readability  i m pretty new to python still  so i m trying to figure out how to do this and need some help.    i use return codes to verify that my internal functions return successfully. for example (from internal library functions):   <pre><code>result = some_function(arg1 arg2) if result != ok: return result </code></pre>   or (from main script level):   <pre><code>result = some_function(arg1 arg2) if result != ok: abort_on_error( could not complete  some_function : %s  % messages(result)) </code></pre>   can i get this down to one line without making it unreadable     edit: some people are recognizing that exceptions might be a better choice. i wanted to save exceptions only for very  exceptional  scenario capturing. the return codes may be expected to fail at times  and i thought it was generally bad practice to use exceptions for this scenario.,python

unpacking more than one list as argument for a function  if i have a function like:   <pre><code>def f(a b c d):     print a b c d </code></pre>   then why does this works:   <pre><code>f(1 2 3 4) f(*[1 2 3 4]) </code></pre>   but not this:   <pre><code>f(*[1 2]   *[3 4])     f(*[1 2]   *[3 4])                ^ syntaxerror: invalid syntax </code></pre>        <strong>edit</strong> : for information  the original problem was to replace one of the argument in a function wrapper. i wanted to replace a given member of the inputted *args and tried something like:   <pre><code>def vectorize_pos(f n=0):             decorator  vectorize the processing of the nth argument     :param f: function that dont accept a list as nth argument             def vectorizedfunction(*args **kwargs):         if isinstance(args[n] list):             return map(lambda x : f( *(args[:n])   x   *(args[n+1 :])  **kwargs) args[n])         else:             return f(*args **kwargs)     return vectorizedfunction </code></pre>   that s where the question arose from. and i know there is other way do do the same thing but only wanted to understand why unpacking one sequence worked but not for more.,python
remove a specific phrase from a list of lists  i have stored data in a list of lists (i couldn t use a dict because i need to have duplicate keys). the list is like:   <pre><code>data = [[1   name email@email.com address ]  [2   name2 email@@email2.com address ]  ...] </code></pre>   my goal is to remove the email addresses from the data list (i.e. the list of lists). unfortunately  the email addresses are all different. they only share one common trait: they all contain the symbol  @ .    i tried to use list comprehensions. however  i can only do it so that the entire element gets removed  i.e.  name email@email.com address  gets removed entirely:   <pre><code>newlist = [element for element in data.split() if  @  not in elment] </code></pre>   i thought of splitting  name email@email.com address  into sublists using     as the delimiter. however  that presents a problem as well: it ruins the format. it would be difficult for me to group the lists together to the initial format  because sometimes  name email@email.com address  contains more than three words. for example  it could be   name1 name2 name3 email@email.com email2 email3 address1 address2 address3 .    what is the best way of doing this     edit:    to answer adam smith s question  i m looking for   <pre><code>data = [[1   name address ]  [2   name2 address ]  ...] </code></pre>   as my output. in other words  the original format (list of lists  where the sublists contain two elements  one being the number and the other one being  name  address  address1  etc ) is preserved without the email addresses.,python

how do i repeat a for loop while maintaining values from the previous for loop   i have written a function for gradient descent and am stuck on figuring out how to repeat the for loop  iters  times. x is a 2d array and y is a 2d array. y is the target value and x is the data that corresponds to the target value. i want to iterate through both simultaneously hence the zip() in the for loop  but i also want to be able to repeat iterating through x and y but with the updated coefficients.    i tried wrapping the for loop in a while loop  but i get an error saying that the zip argument #2 must support iteration. i m assuming that what is happening is that once the for loop iterates through the 2 ndarrays  the compiler cannot  reset  and loop through the arrays again. am i correct and how do i fix this     <pre><code>def gradient_descent_lr(x y alpha iters):     x_coef = 0     y_int = 0     coef_list = []      for x  y in zip(x y):         #evaluate func (0 first)         f_eval = (x_coef * x) + y_int         #find error         error = f_eval - y         #update coefficients         y_int = y_int - (alpha*error) #adjust bias coefficient by the error         x_coef = x_coef - (alpha*error*x)         coef_list.append((float(y_int) float(x_coef)))  return coef_list </code></pre>   edit:     nevermind  i figured out that the problem wasn t in iterations  the problem was in having the variable name being y in both the argument and in the for loop. you can close this question.,python

using recursion in python class methods  nb noob alert ...  !    i am trying to use recursion in a python class method  but with limited results.    i m trying to build a car class  with very basic attributes: id  position in a one lane road (represented by an integer)  and velocity. one of the functions i have is used to return which car id is in front on this one -- i.e. if we have class:   <pre><code>class car:     def __init__(self  position  id  velocity):         self.position = position         self.id = id         self.velocity = velocity </code></pre>   now  i ve come up with the following class method (additional details below the code):   <pre><code>def findsuccessorcar(self  cars):      successorcar =        smallestgapfound = 20000000       for car in cars:         if car.id == self.id: continue          currentgap = self.calculategap(car)          if (currentgap &gt; -1) and (currentgap &lt; smallestgapfound):             smallestgapfound = currentgap             successorcar = car      if successorcar ==   :         return 1 # calling code checks for 1 as an error code     else:                 return successorcar </code></pre>   the plan is to create car objects  then store them in a list. each time the findsuccessormethod is called  this global list of cars is passed to it  e.g.    <pre><code>    c1 = testcar.car(4  5  1) # position  pos_y  vel  id         c2 = testcar.car(7  9  2)         c3 = testcar.car(9  1  2)         cars = [c1  c2  c3]          c1_succ = c1.findsuccessorcar(cars) </code></pre>   this works fine: the find successor car function will say that car c2 is in front of car c1 (position 7 ahead of position 4).    however  i want car c1 to work out what car is in front of its immediate successor -- that is  which car is in front of the car in front  which in this case is car c3. my thinking was that if i did c1_succ.findsuccessorcars(cars) then this should work fine: doing type(c1_succ) shows it is an instance and hasattr shows that it has the anticipated object attributes.     however  when i do try to execute c1_succ.findsuccessorcars(cars)  an integer is returned. hence  i am confused -- why doesn t this work  why can you not recursively execute a class method in this fashion  where does this integer come from     nb gut feel says that this has something to do with the self declaration  and that i ll need to modify my code so that as well as a global list of cars  there ll need to be a global list of their current positions  or another class method  e.g.  findsuccessorssuccessor (yes  fully aware of crummy naming!). however  i am interested to understand why this recursive approach does not work.     update    here is the requested code for calculating a gap between 2 cars -- i appreciate it is very basic  so not too much laughter at the back please.   <pre><code>    def calculategap(self  car):             calculate the gap between two cars                     thiscar = self         othercar = car          gap = othercar.position_x - thiscar.position_x           return gap </code></pre>,python
how to cancel python schedule  i have a repeated python schedule task as following which need to run getmystock() every 3 minutes in startmonitor():   <pre><code>from stocktrace.util import settings import time  os  sys  sched schedule = sched.scheduler(time.time  time.sleep)  def periodic(scheduler  interval  action  actionargs=()):   scheduler.enter(interval  1  periodic                    (scheduler  interval  action  actionargs))   action(*actionargs)   def startmonitor():         from stocktrace.parse.sinaparser import getmystock             periodic(schedule  settings.polling_interval  getmystock)     schedule.run( ) </code></pre>   the questions are:    1.how could i cancel or stop the schedule when some user event comes     2.is there any other python module for better repeated scheduling just like java quartz,python
comparing a word in a list to a word in a file  i m trying to write a program that loops through a list and checks a file to see if that word is in there. at first  the file is read and then if a word is found  it breaks out of that loop. with the remaining lines in the file after that word is found  i want to compare with the list. the code below isn t working. it just breaks out of the loop and doesn t find the word.  thanks for your assistance.    <pre><code>def readfile(): with open( file.txt    r ) as myfile:     for line in myfile:         if  hello  in line:             break     for word in mylist:         if word in myfile:            print(word +  found ) </code></pre>,python
merged sort algorithm  i have a merge algorithm which is really fast: it s currently set up to check unknown words between lists; this function checks common words  i need to change the function below to check if words are in vocab or wds or neither i don t properly understand the function so any comments about what specific lines do would be great.    def find_unknowns_merge_pattern(vocab  wds):   <pre><code>result = [] xi = 0 yi = 0  while true:     if xi &gt;= len(vocab):         result.extend(wds[yi:])         return result      if yi &gt;= len(wds):         return result      if vocab[xi] == wds[yi]:  # good  word exists in vocab         yi += 1      elif vocab[xi] &lt; wds[yi]: # move past this vocab word          xi += 1      else:                     # got word that is not in vocab         result.append(wds[yi])         yi += 1 </code></pre>   def check(bigger_vocab book_words):   <pre><code>    both = [ ]         for words in bigger_vocab:             for people in book_words:                 if words == people:                     words.split()                     both.append(words)      return both </code></pre>   the problem is it takes at least 5 seconds whereas my merge algorithm takes 0.08. how can i call that function so i can make this one faster,python

variable set to function call returns none  i am making a simple ceaser cipher program in python  and this concept has confused me for quite some time.    what i do is ask for raw_input from users to determine the message and key for the cipher like so:   <pre><code>def user_input():     ask_user = raw_input( do you want to encrypt or decrypt a     message  )     if ask_user in  encrypt e .split():         message = get_message()         key = get_key()         translate_message(message  key)     else:         print  type encrypt or e for encryption  or decrypt or d doe decryption          user_input() </code></pre>   this collects the message and key  and passes into translate_message for the actual encryption.    here is my get_message function:   <pre><code>def get_message():     get_user_message = raw_input( enter in your message\n )     vm = validate_message(get_user_message)     if not vm:         print  please enter a valid message          get_message()     else:         print get_user_message         return get_user_message </code></pre>   i want to validate the input to make sure the user enters the correct values. if the value is incorrect according to validate_message it calls get_message again  else get_message returns the original value.    here s validate_message:   <pre><code>def validate_message(message):     if not re.match(r ^[a-za-z]+$   message):         return false     return true </code></pre>   just a simple check (i like my functions to do one thing)    normally  this runs fine and the key &amp; message values are returned like normal. the problem comes when i intentionally input incorrect values to test my validation.    here s what translate_message returns without incorrect values(it just returns the two values):   <pre><code> test_message   22 </code></pre>   the confusion comes when i input incorrect values. say i enter 3333 (will recall get_message() because of incorrect value)  until the user enters correct input. translate_message returns none if the user enters any kind of incorrect value before successfully entering a value   <pre><code>none  22 </code></pre>   in the get_message() function i add a print statement right before the return value  which prints out the correct value as expected. so why is    key = get_key()    equaling to none  i went through the logic in get_message() and i can t see where the return value is equal to none when it should return the users correct guess.    any help is appreciated  and if there is a better way to implement this type of logic  i d like to know! i m fairly new to python programming.    thanks!,python

zip together each element of one list  start with a list of strings. each string will have the same number of characters  but that number is not predetermined  nor is the unrelated total number of strings.    here is an example:   <pre><code>data = [ abc    efg    ijk    mno ] </code></pre>   my desired final output is something like:   <pre><code>[( a    e    i    m )  ( b    f    j    n )  ( c    g    k    o )] </code></pre>   my desired output is what i am expecting to see after using <code>zip()</code> in some way. my problem is that i cannot find the right way to zip each element of one array together.    essentially  i am trying to get the columns out of a group of rows.    <strong>what i have tried so far:</strong>   <ol> <li> splitting the data into a two dimensional list:     <code>split_data = [list(row) for row in rows]</code> </li> </ol>   which gives me:   <pre><code>[[ a    b    c ]  [ e    f    g ]  [ i    j    k ]  [ m    n    o ]] </code></pre>  <ol start= 2 > <li> trying to use <code>zip()</code> on that with something like:     <code>zip(split_data)</code> </li> </ol>   i continue to end up with this:   <pre><code>[([ a    b    c ] )  ([ e    f    g ] )  ([ i    j    k ] )  ([ m    n    o ] )] </code></pre>   obviously  it is zipping each element with nothing  causing it to return the original data tupled with a blank. how can i get <code>zip()</code> to consider each element of <code>data</code> or <code>split_data</code> as a list that should be zipped     what i need is <code>zip(data[0]  data[1]  data[2]  ...)</code>,python

does the python sys.path act like unix path   let s say i have a local development directory with modules that i m writing  and a system-wide site-packages directory where these modules will eventually be installed. in the case where i m modifying an existing module and i want to test it i would like to be sure that the module i m importing is the one in my local site-packages directory. reading about the <a href= http://docs.python.org/2/library/site.html  rel= nofollow >site</a> module it seems like i can have a file with a <code>.pth</code> suffix where each line in that file will be appended to the <code>sys.path</code> variable. i ve set that up  and i can confirm that my development directory is showing up later in the list  but when i import a module it s importing from the system wide directory.    simplified example:   <pre><code>$ virtualenv test_sys $ cd test_sys $ source bin/activate $ mkdir site_modules $ mkdir user_modules </code></pre>   in each site_modules and user_modules i ve put a directory called <code>test_module</code> with the following in the <code>__init__.py</code>:   <pre><code>import os  print(os.path.abspath(__file__)) </code></pre>   now i ve added a file called <code>site_modules.pth</code> to <code>test_sys/lib/python2.7/site-packages</code>:   <pre><code>/home/chris/test_sys/site_modules /home/chris/test_sys/user_modules </code></pre>   and i expect that when i import test_module from the python interpreter it would print the <code>user_modules</code> directory but it doesn t:   <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import test_module /home/chris/test_sys/site_modules/test_module/__init__.pyc &gt;&gt;&gt; </code></pre>   yes  i ve ensured that <code>user_modules</code> shows up later in <code>sys.path</code> than <code>site_modules</code>.    how can i ensure that a module that exists in multiple directories in <code>sys.path</code> will always be imported from a specific directory,python
status of chained assignment in python  at several occasions i stumbled upon c-style assignment in python such as <code>a = b = 0</code>. by diligent googling i found out that this is called chained assignment: [<a href= http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/assignment_%28computer_science%29#chained_assignment  rel= nofollow noreferrer >1</a>] [<a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11498441/what-is-this-kind-of-assignment-in-python-called-a-b-true >2</a>] [<a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7601823/how-do-chained-assignments-work >3</a>]. however  it appears that this feature is not mentioned in the <a href= http://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#assignment-statements  rel= nofollow noreferrer >official documentation</a>.    does this mean that chained assignment is still in experimental phase  or simply that the official documentation is slightly behind the development,python

in what order should the python concepts be explained to absolute beginners   i am teaching python to undergraduate math majors. i am interested in the optimal order in which students should be introduced to various python concepts. in my view  at each stage the students should be able to solve a non-trivial programming problem using only the tools available at that time. each new tool should enable a simpler solution to a familiar problem. a selection of numerous concepts available in python is essential in order to keep students focused. they should also motivated and should appreciate each newly mastered tool without too much memorization.  here are some specific questions:    <ul> <li>for instance  my predecessor introduced lists before strings. i think the opposite is a better solution. </li> <li>should function definitions be introduced at the very beginning or after mastering basic structured programming ideas  such as decisions (if) and loops (while)  </li> <li>should sets be introduced before dictionaries </li> <li>is it better to introduce reading and writing files early in the course or should one use input and print for most of the course </li> </ul>   any suggestions with explanations are most welcome.    <strong>edit:</strong> in high school the students were introduced to computers. a few of them learned how to program. prior to this they had a course  covering word  excel  powerpoint  html  latex  a taste of mathematica  but no programming. 5 years ago i used mathematica in this course and the follow-up course uses c and later java. now i teach introduction to python and in the follow-up course my colleague teaches object-oriented programming in python. later a student may take special courses on data structures  algorithms  optimization and in some elective courses they learn on their own mathematica  matlab and r.,python

python immutable object from within function  i asked a previous question on stackoverflow here: <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5653150/python-immutable-types-in-function-calls >python immutable types in function calls</a>     which made it clear that only references to immutable objects are passed to functions  and so passing a tuple to a function does <em>not</em> result in a full memory copy of that object.    however  according to: <a href= http://www.testingreflections.com/node/view/5126  rel= nofollow noreferrer >http://www.testingreflections.com/node/view/5126</a>    <blockquote>     some objects  like strings  tuples    and numbers  are immutable. <em>altering</em>   them inside a function/method will   create a new instance and the original   instance outside the function/method   is not changed.   </blockquote>   i wrote some test code  where an immutable object is passed to a function. as expected  i can modify the object via the parameter-name/reference defined as part of the function header  and all changes only persist within the called function  leaving the original object outside of the function untouched.    so my question is:    is the new instance created <em>only when an attempt is made to alter/modify</em> the object passed in  i m guessing that if the object is not changed  a reference to it is all that is required. <strong>more importantly  if it does create a copy upon attempted modification  how does python manage the memory  with a zero-copy/copy-on-write  or does it create a complete replicated object (with the whole object s size reserved in memory) visible only within the called function </strong>,python

is there an easy way to convert a string containing a string literal into the string it represents   i m trying to (slightly) improve a script that does a quick-and-hacky parse of some config files.    upon recognising  an item  read from the file  i need to try to convert it into a simple python value. the value could be a number or a string.    to convert strings read from the file into python numbers i can just use <code>int</code> or <code>float</code> and catch the <code>valueerror</code> if it wasn t actually a number. is there something similar for python strings  i.e.   <pre><code>s1 =  goodbye world. :(  s2 = repr(s1) s3 =      not a string literal       s4 = s3.strip()  v1 = parse_string_literal(s1) # throws valueerror v2 = parse_string_literal(s2) # returns  goodby world. :(  v3 = parse_string_literal(s3) # throws valueerror v4 = parse_string_literal(s4) # returns  not a string literal  </code></pre>   in the file  string values are represented very similarly to python string literals; they can be quoted with either   or    and could contain backslash escapes  etc. i could roll my own parser with regexes  but if there s something already existing i d rather not re-invent the wheel.    i could use <code>eval</code> of course  but that s always somewhat dangerous.,python
how to use python to fill in dates and values so that every day has the same number of entries   i have a data set that looks like the table below. every day has time stamps with 15 minutes interval  so there should be 15*24 = 96 entries per day. it is important that each day has the same number of values  because the np.corrceof() function i will use later to find the correlation of each day requires this.    <pre><code>date               value 5/1/2015 0:00:00    23 5/1/2015 0:15:00    22 5/1/2015 0:30:00    50 ...... 5/1/2015 23:30:00   60 5/1/2015 23:45:00   27 </code></pre>   however  the problem right now is that some days are missing values. for example  5/2/2016 below only have two entries.    <pre><code>5/2/2015 0:00:00    60 5/2/2015 0:15:00    45 5/3/2015 0:00:00    60   ...... </code></pre>   what i hope to do is to complete the 5/2/2015 time series by adding 94 extra rows (0:30:00  0:45:00  ...23:45:00)  and use 45 (the last value in 5/2/2015) as the duplicate for all the  fake data  created for the rest of this day. i also hope the script can do the same for the other days that are missing values.    i heard about the python interpolation function (scipy.interpolate) but it does not seem to work here      apologize for not showing any coding examples as i have no clues how to do it in a pythonian way. if you could give me a small example of how to solve this problem or just point me to the right function that would be great. thank you for your help in advance!,python

python for loop doesn t have expected results  i got a bit stuck with a for loop - what i can see it is doing appears correct but isn t exactly what i m trying to accomplish with it. i ve come from a c background but any advice here would be beneficial.   <pre><code>def deal(player_num  cards):     a = 0     z = 0     i = 0     b = 0     c = player_num     hand = [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16]         for a in range(player_num):         hand[a] = cards[i] + cards[i+b+c]         b == b+1         i == i+1         z == z+1     return hand  </code></pre>   so the <code>for a in range(player_num)</code> seems to be working (appends <code>a++</code>) but <code>hand[0]</code>  <code>hand[1]</code>  etc. gets the same hand. i guess it loops a but not the other variables  so i need to use more than 1 nested loop to get <code>i++</code>  <code>b++</code> and <code>c++</code>,python

how can i print many significant figures in python   for a scientific application i need to output very precise numbers  so i have to print 15 significant figures. there are already questions on this topic here  but they all concern with <em>truncating</em> the digits  not <em>printing more</em>.    i realized that the <code>print</code> function converts the input <code>float</code> to a 10 character <code>string</code>. also  i became aware of the <code>decimal</code> module  but that does not suit my needs.     so the question is  how can i easily print a variable amount of signifcant figures of my floats  where i need to display more than 10,python

removing uppercase letters from a string in python  i am trying to write a function eliminate that takes a string and 2 optional arguments. the first optional argument (bad_characters) takes a letter and the third argument (case_sensitive) takes a boolean value. the function should take a string s and remove all instances of bad_characters. if case_sensitive is true  then the function should act case sensitive. if false  then it does not need to. this is what i have so far.   <pre><code>def eliminate(s bad_characters = [] case_sensitive = true or false):         takes a string s and returns the string with all bad_characters     removed. if case_sensitive is true  then the function will only     remove uppercase letters if there are uppercase letters in     bad_characters.     string --&gt; string        while true:         if case_sensitive = false:             for character in s:                 if bad_characters == character:                     newlist = s.replace(bad_characters   )                     return newlist         break </code></pre>   i am having a hard time figuring out how to make the function remove upper case letters if needed. the function should also work if bad_characters is a list  tuple  or string.,python

how can i  fix  floating numbers in python by intelligently choosing the correct decimal place to round to   i ve seen many discussions here about rounding floating values in python or similar topics  but i have a related problem that i want a good solution for.    context:    i use the netcdf4 python library to extract data from netcdf files. my organization keeps a precision attribute on variables within these files.    example: <code>ts:data_precision = 0.01f ;</code>    i collect these precision attributes using the library like this:   <pre><code>d = netcdf4.dataset(path) # assume path is the file or url link precisions = {} for v in d.variables:     try:         precisions[v] = d.variables[v].__getattribute__( data_precision )     except attributeerror:         pass return precisions </code></pre>  <hr>   when i retrieve these precision values from a dataset  in python they end up showing up like:   <pre><code>{u lat : 9.9999997e-05  u lon : 9.9999997e-05  u ts : 0.0099999998  u ssps : 0.0099999998} </code></pre>   but  what i really want is:   <pre><code>{u lat : 0.0001  u lon : 0.0001  u ts : 0.01  u ssps : 0.01} </code></pre>  <hr>   essentially i need a way in python to intelligently round these values to their most appropriate decimal place. i am sure i can come up with a really ugly method to do this  but i want to know if there is already a  nice  solution to this problem.    for my use case  i suppose i can take advantage of the fact that since these values are all  data_precision  values  i can just count the zero s from the decimal place  and then round to the last 0. (i m making the assumption that <code>0 &lt; n &lt; 1</code>). with these assumptions  this would be my solution:   <pre><code>#/usr/bin/python  def intelli_round(n):     def get_decimal_place(n):         count = 0         while n &lt; 1:             n *= 10             count += 1         return count     return round(n  get_decimal_place(n))  examples = [0.0099999  0.00000999  0.99999] for e in examples:     print e  intelli_round(e) </code></pre>   .   <pre><code>0.0099999 0.01 9.99e-06 1e-05 0.99999 1.0 </code></pre>   does this seem appropriate  it seems to work under the constraints  but i m curious to see alternatives.,python

importing python modules from a distant directory  what s the shortest way to import a module from a distant  relative directory     we ve been using this code which isn t too bad except your current working directory <em>has</em> to be the same as the directory as this code s or the relative path breaks  which can be error prone and confusing to users.   <pre><code>import sys sys.path.append( ../../../path/to/shared/code ) </code></pre>   this code (i think) fixes that problem but is a lot more to type.   <pre><code>import os sys sys.path.append(os.path.realpath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__)   ../../../path/to/shared/code ))) </code></pre>   is there a shorter way to append the absolute path  the brevity matters because this is going to have to be typed/appear in a lot of our files. (we can t factor it out because then it would be in the shared code and we couldn t get to it. chicken &amp; egg  bootstrapping  etc.)    plus it bothers me that we keep blindly appending to sys.path but that would be even more code. i sure wish something in the standard library could help with this.    this will typically appear in script files which are run from the command line. we re running python 2.6.2.    <strong>edit:</strong> the reason we re using relative paths is that we typically have multiple  independent copies of the codebase on our computers. it s important that each copy of the codebase use its own copy of the shared code. so any solution which supports only a single code base (e.g.   put it in site-packages. ) won t work for us.    any suggestions  thank you!,python

importing modules from packages in python  such a basic issue i guess i can t even find the answer anyhwere  so my first python program  i downloaded the macholib package from pypi  then unzipped it and ran installed the setup.py using python install  now i m trying to run a program where i first import the macholib  then when i try to access methods like macho  it gives me an error saying macholib module has no attributes called macho. my understanding is macholib is a package and not a module or something  hence i cant use the contents of the package. please answer  i ve wasted too much time on such a simple newbie issue. running a mac with the latest version of python.    code:   <pre><code>import sys import macholib macho(divxinstaller.dmg)  </code></pre>   i tried macholib.macho(divxinstaller.dmg) and macholib.macho.macho(divxinstaller.dmg)   <pre><code>error for python test.py  traceback (most recent call last):   file  test.py   line 3  in &lt;module&gt;     macho(divxinstaller.dmg) nameerror: name  macho  is not defined </code></pre>,python

list comprehension squaring odds  this is what i am supposed to do:   <blockquote>    given the variable <code>nums</code>  whose value is a list of integers  write an assignment statement that assigns to the variable <code>square_odds</code> the list of the squares of the odd numbers in the list <code>nums</code>.         you must use list comprehension.  </blockquote>   here is what i have so far  i know the range part is wrong but what is it supposed to look like    <pre><code>nums = [2 ** square_odds for square_odds in range(nums) if square_odds != x%2] </code></pre>   i think there are other places that are wrong but i am not sure.    i changed it to    <pre><code>nums = [square_odds**2 for square_odds in range(100) if square_odds%2 != 0]  </code></pre>   i received the message    wrong: you have not assigned to square_odds.,python

file input and output in python  stripping of space and outputting to list  i am writing a program in python to take 5 lines of input from a file  var_input  and input it into a list  and then input each seperate number into the list first or second     i am just wondering what the best way would be to go about separating the space from in between each number and then appending it to the lists first or second. i am thinking about using python s split method but i am not sure about how to do this    data in input file would look like this   <pre><code>18 24                10 5 101 567 234 90 107 4567 </code></pre>   first should contain <code>[ 18    10    101    234    107 ]</code>    second should contain <code>[ 24    5    567    90    4567 ]</code>          here s what i have so far   <pre><code>first = [] second = []  file_input = open( var_input ) input_list = file_input.readlines() </code></pre>   thank you so much  any help would be greatly appreciated,python
extracting year from date column using panda  so i have a csv containing a bunch of columns  <code>date</code> being one of them  which i m mostly interested in right now. i ve managed to extract the column from the file  but i m not interested in the entire date  only the  year  part of it.   <pre><code>with open( /users/thomasjn/documents/sfpd_incidents.csv    r ) as f:     data = pd.read_csv(f)      dates = data[ date ].str.split( / ) </code></pre>   this is what i ve done so far  which gives me a result like this:   <pre><code>0          [01  19  2015 12:00:00 am] 1          [02  01  2015 12:00:00 am] 2          [02  01  2015 12:00:00 am] 3          [02  01  2015 12:00:00 am] 4          [01  27  2015 12:00:00 am] 5          [02  01  2015 12:00:00 am] </code></pre>   but how do i remove everything from the date except the year,python
what does it mean to have two parameters in a getattr()   from the python official doc  i saw the normal expression of getattr();    getattr(object  name[  default])    i understood it quite well. for example  i can do:   <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def a(): ...     pass ... &gt;&gt;&gt; c = 2 &gt;&gt;&gt; getattr(a   b   c) 2 </code></pre>   but in the code i m viewing now  the author use a pattern like:   <pre><code>getattr(a  b.x)(b.y) </code></pre>   and i even didn t find  b  in  a  object!    this confused me a lot  what does this code mean    <hr>   appendix 1:    the getattr() is between a plenty of import statements.  and the original expression is like:   <pre><code> from tornado.options import define  options  import settings         getattr(settings  options.env)(options.server_name) </code></pre>,python
c style chars in python  i m new to python programming but experienced in c.  i can t figure out what the equivalent to a char in python is.  from what i read there isn t one.  a  char  in python is a one character string.  in fact it might even be more than 1 byte if its unicode.  i need to create a packet of data using bytes (read chars) that s say 128 bytes long and may contain nulls.  i then want to write that packet to a serial port as a series of bytes not a string.    whats the python equivalent of:   <pre><code>char buffer[128]; buffer[12] =  0x04  buffer[15] =  0x00      ...etc </code></pre>,python

why does a python script to read files cause my computer to emit beeping sounds   i wrote a little module that will search files in a directory and all of its sub-directories for the occurrence of some input string. it s been handy a few times  mostly to find old scripts if i remember some function/variable name that i used.    so  i was completely baffled the other day when i used the functions and started hearing  very faintly  from the headphones sitting on the far side of my desk  repeated beeping sounds. at first i thought it was somebody s phone ringing. but no  python was communicating with me via morse code.    i have no clue why this is happening. i ve continued running the functions and getting beeps  not always in the same pattern. the functions only open files with read permission. the code is exactly this:   <pre><code>import os import glob  def directory_crawl_for_string(dir_name  string  ofile):        crawl dir_name and all of its subdirectories  opening files and     checking for the presence of a string         #get input directory s listings     dir_contents = glob.glob(dir_name)     #loop over the listings     for dir_element in dir_contents:         if(os.path.isfile(dir_element)):             #read the file  checking for the string             check_for_string(dir_element  string  ofile)         else:             if(os.path.isdir(dir_element)):                 directory_crawl_for_string(dir_element +  \\*   string  ofile)  def check_for_string(dir_element  string  ofile):      try:         ifile = open(dir_element   r )     except ioerror as e:         pass     else:         count = 1         for line in ifile:             if(string in line.lower()):                 print count line dir_element                 ofile.write( %s %d %s  % (dir_element  count  line))             count += 1         ifile.close()  def init_crawl(start_dir  string  output_dir):        args:             start_dir - directory to start the crawl at             string - string to search for             output_dir - directory to write output text file inside of         if(output_dir):         fn = output_dir.rstrip( / ).rstrip( \\ ) +  /dirs.txt      else:         fn =  dirs.txt      ofile = open(fn   w )     ofile.write( file path line number of occurance of  %s  exact line\n  % string)     directory_crawl_for_string(start_dir  string  ofile)     ofile.close()     print( list of files containing  %s  written to  %s   % (string  fn)) </code></pre>   to start it  you pass <code>init_crawl()</code> the directory to crawl down from  the string to search for  and a directory to write an output text file into. for example: <code>init_crawl(r c:\directory-to-crawl    foo   r c:\output-directory )</code>    i don t even know what specific questions to ask about this  but why is it happening  i can tell that the beeps generally occur when the function tries to read non-text files like pdfs and spreadsheets. sometimes the terminal freezes too...    the output is just a csv with columns for file paths where the string is found  line numbers  and the line containing the string.,python

checking the input and output file are not the same in python  i have a python script that takes in two arguments  the name of the input and output files  i.e. it starts of like   <pre><code>inputfile=open(sys.argv[1]  r ) outfile=open(sys.argv[2]  w ) </code></pre>   then performs whatever operation reading from inputfile and writing to the outfile.    now a few times through human error i ve accidentally given the same argument twice  the result being that my input file is replaced with a blank line. is there are a straight-forward way to stop this happening     i thought it might be as simple as adding   <pre><code>if sys.argv[1]==sys.argv[2]:         inputfile.close()         outfile.close() </code></pre>   immediately after the first lines above  but this already leaves the file blank.,python

packaging python program in a single executable  hi i need to package a python program in to a single executable. i need to have a executable that does not need a python installation and third party packages.    so need to have    <pre><code>python 2.7.5 wmi==1.4.9 pyjs==0.1.0 pywin32==219 requests==2.4.3 urllib3==1.9.1 </code></pre>   is this even possible  i need to able to make a executable to to be run on a freshly installed windows xp+ machine.    i tried pyinstaller  but after that i could not execute the file. which tool could provide everything needed,python
python: how do you intercept a method call to change function parameters   what i am trying to do is write a wrapper around another module so that i can transform the parameters that are being passed to the methods of the other module. that was fairly confusing  so here is an example:   <pre><code>import somemodule  class wrapper:     def __init__(self):         self.transforms = {}         self.transforms[ t ] =  test       # this next function is the one i want to exist     # please understand the lines below will not compile and are not real code     def __intercept__(self  item  *args  **kwargs):         if  t  in args:             args[args.index( t )] = self.transforms[ t ]         return somemodule.item(*args  **kwargs) </code></pre>   the goal is to allow users of the wrapper class to make simplified calls to the underlying module without having to rewrite all of the functions in the module. so in this case if <code>somemodule</code> had a function called <code>print_uppercase</code> then the user could do   <pre><code>w = wrapper() w.print_uppercase( t ) </code></pre>   and get the output   <pre><code>test </code></pre>   i believe the answer lies in <code>__getattr__</code> but i m not totally sure how to use it for this application.,python

create a cashregister class that is used with retailitem class  create a cashregister class that can be used with the retailitem class.  the cashregister class should be able to internally keep a list of retailitem objects.  the class should have the following methods:    â€¢   a method named purchase_item method that accepts a retailitem object as an argument. each time the purchase_item method is called  the retailitem object that is passed as an argement should be added to the list. â€¢   a method name get_total that returns the total price of all the retailitem objects stored in the cashregister objectâ€™s internal list. â€¢   a method name show_items that displays data about the retailitem objects stored in the cashregister objectâ€™s internal list. â€¢   a method named clear that should clear the cashregister objectâ€™s internal list.    demonstrate the cashregister class in a program that allows the user to select several items for purchase.  when the user is ready to check out  the program should display a list of all the items he or she has selected for purchase  as well as the total price.   <pre><code>class retailitem:      # the __init__ method initializes the attributes.     def __init__(self  item  units  price):         self.__item = item         self.__units = units         self.__price = price      # the following methods are mutators for the class.     def set_item(self  item):         self.__item = item     def set_units(self  units):         self.__units = units     def set_price(self  price):         self.__price = price      # the following methods are accessors for the class.     def get_item(self):         return self.__item     def get_units(self):         return self.__units     def get_price(self):         return self.__price      # the __str__ method returns the object s state as a     #   string.     def __str__(self):         return  item description:  + self.__item  \                \tnumber of units:  + self.__units  \                \tprice: $  + self.__price      # the decrementinventory function decreases the number     #   units each time called.     def decrementinventory(units):         if units &gt;

about learning python online and motivations  i wanted to ask you something important to me. i m already learning python because i think is a good starter programming lenguage  and i m learning python at codeacademy. but the exercises sometimes have strange answers.. i really love computers  and i like programming  that s why i want to learn this. one question  when you were learning python  did you descouraged easily and did you think  oh  was that the answer  i knew how to do it  but why didn t i think of that  would i be good programming  i cannot do nothing without a tutorial..  did any of you think of that     what online page for learning python would you recommend me  i know codeacademy is very good  but some of the exercises i don t know how to do it  i don t care if i learn python in 2 or 3 weeks 3 hours-a-day  but i want a good page that explains correctly all that stuff.    i want to program games  i know that python is not specially made for games but i need to start with a easy language and i like python  but i need a better explanation page with exercises to do in that page because i want learn a good python lenguage. what would you recommend me  how did you motivate yourself when you were learning python  what did you think learning python     i m sorry for the bad english and sorry  cause this is not a  programming  question  but this is important for me and my future  so please forgive me. greetings and thanks in advance!,python
python: my code repeats itself after it should have finished  i am writing a rock  paper  scissors game in python but my code doesn t work as it should. i m new to python so please let me know if my code isn t formatted corectly. the game runs fine  assuming you enter one of the already existing answers. however  if you enter one that is different  the code seems to loop randomly after the  end()  function is executed.    here is my code:    <pre><code># imports needed files from random import randint import time # creates a function that ends the game def end(cpuscore playerscore):     time.sleep(1)     cont = input( would you like to play again  (y or n)\n )     if cont== y :         time.sleep(1)         start()     else:         print( well... that s a bit rude. ) # creates a function to play the game def rps(cpuscore playerscore num):     # loops code 3 times (unless  num  is different)     for x in range(num):         num-=1         # creates options         options = [ rock   paper   scissors ]         # picks a random choice for cpu         cpu = options[randint(0 2)]         # asks the player to choose         player = input( rock  paper or scissors \n )         # why not gun          if player== gun :             result =  w          elif player==cpu:             result =  d          elif player== rock :             if cpu== paper :                 result =  l              if cpu== scissors :                 result =  w          elif player== paper :             if cpu== scissors :                 result =  l              if cpu== rock :                 result =  w          elif player== scissors :             if cpu== rock :                 result =  l              if cpu== paper :                 result =  w          # if they choose something other than rock  paper  scissors or gun         else:             print( that s an invalid input! )             # adds one to num so that this round is not counted as one of the 3             num+=1             # plays the game again with the amount of rounds remaining             rps(cpuscore playerscore num)          # tells the player how they did         if result== w :             playerscore+=1             time.sleep(1)             print( fine! you win! your silly   + player +   beat my   + cpu +  !!! )         if result== l :             cpuscore+=1             time.sleep(1)             print( ha! sucker!! my epic   + cpu +   smashed your measly   + player +  !!! )         if result== d :             time.sleep(1)             print( ah! we drew by both choosing %s! like they say  great minds think alike!  % cpu)         # announces the scores         print( you are on %s and the computer is on %s!  % (playerscore cpuscore))     # ends the game after 3 rounds     end(cpuscore playerscore) # creates the funtion that sets the variables and starts the game def start():     result=       cont=       cpuscore=0     playerscore=0     rps(cpuscore playerscore 3) # begins the game start() </code></pre>   thanks  reece coombes,python

raspberry pi: detect camera with if loop  gphoto2  i m trying to find a way to detect if a camera is found for gphoto2  or not.    i ve posted in the gphoto2 forum  but figured i d try here too. one can issue the command  gphoto2 --auto-detect  and it will list cameras that are detected.    i m running a large python script that at one point  calls gphoto2 to take a picture and download the image. i m wanting to find a statement that i can put in an if loop  to where the take picture and download image command is only issued after entering in the loop if the camera is detected.,python

string split with minimum size  i am writing a python script that will accept a dot-delimited version number. it will split this string into individual components (using period (<code>.</code>) as a delimiter). my script supports up to 4 components (e.g. <code>1.2.3.4</code>). however  the user may specify <em>less</em> or <em>more</em> components than 4 and my script needs to be able to handle it.    if less than 4  the list that i get back from <code>string.split()</code> needs to be resized to 4 and missing components initialized to the string <code> 0 </code>. if greater than 4  just truncate the elements past the 4th component.    the truncation is easy  i would just splice the list. however  i m not sure how to perform the resize up to 4 elements. is there a pythonic way of doing this  or do i need to hand-write a bunch of logic to do it     i m using python 3.2.,python

finding values that exist for every dictionary in a list  i have a list of lists that each have several dictionaries. the first list represents every coordinate involved in a triangulation. the second list represents a list of dictionaries associated with that grid coordinate. each dictionary within the list represents every possible coordinate that is a certain manhattan distance away from a line point that we are trying to triangulate  our target. any coordinate that exists within every triangulation list represent the overlapping points from these positions and thus the potential location of our target.    anyway  i gave some background to hopefully add some understanding. i know it probably comes off confusing  but i ll include my data structure to assist in visualizing what is going on. i ve tried looping through these and haven t quite found a way to do this efficiently yet.     does anyone know of some python magic to generate a list of the coordinates that exist in every group of coordinates      so in the example below we are starting with 3 different groups of coordinates. i need to generate a list of any x y pairs that exists in all 3 groups of coordinates.    example:   <pre><code>[     [         { x : 1   y : 0}           { x : -1   y : 0}           { x : 0   y : 1}           { x : 0   y : -1}     ]      [         { x : 2   y : 0}          { x : -2   y : 0}          { x : 0   y : 2}          { x : 0   y : -2}          { x : 1   y : 1}          { x : -1   y : -1}          { x : -1   y : 1}          { x : 1   y : -1}     ]      [         { x : 3   y : 0}          { x : -3   y : 0}          { x : 0   y : 3}          { x : 0   y : -3}          { x : 2   y : 1}          { x : -2   y : -1}          { x : -1   y : 2}          { x : 1   y : -2}          { x : 1   y : 2}          { x : -1   y : -2}          { x : -2   y : 1}          { x : 2   y : -1}     ] ] </code></pre>,python
finding last modified date of files with special extensions  i have written the python script below to find the last modified date of a file:   <pre><code>for root  dirs  files in os.walk(folder_path):     for f in files:         last_modified = datetime.fromtimestamp(os.path.getmtime(f)).day         #do something </code></pre>   this code works fine for normal files like .txt files. however  if it encounters files with extensions like .tar.gz or .run  it throws an error saying  no such file or directory  when finding last_modified.     <strong>* edit *</strong>    i realized that  if i change the code as below  it works fine.   <pre><code> for f in files:         name = os.path.join(root  f)         last_modified = datetime.fromtimestamp(os.path.getmtime(name)).day         #do something </code></pre>   but why does this happen,python

missed values when iterating over a list of tuples  i m using pygrass to automate some gis raster analysis (a raster is a grid of values). i want to use python to iterate over a sub-section of a grid and compare each cell to its nearest neighbors. using pygrass i am able to get the raster as a nested list  e.g. a list of rows where each row is a list of values.    with numpy i am able to get the nearest neighbors of a cell  but i want to make sure that nearest neighbors will only fall within the raster/grid extent. that is to say  if i want the neighbors of a cell that is not at the edge of the grid  it will have 8 neighbors. this is the maximum number of neighbor cells:   <pre><code>+-+-+-+-+-+  |0|0|0|0|0| +-+-+-+-+-+ |0|1|1|1|0| +-+-+-+-+-+ |0|1|x|1|0| +-+-+-+-+-+ |0|1|1|1|0| +-+-+-+-+-+ |0|0|0|0|0| +-+-+-+-+-+ </code></pre>   however  if it is at an edge or corner of the grid  it may have only 5 or 3 neighbors instead:   <pre><code>+-+-+-+-+-+                        +-+-+-+-+-+ |1|1|0|0|0|                        |x|1|0|0|0| +-+-+-+-+-+                        +-+-+-+-+-+ |x|1|0|0|0|                        |1|1|0|0|0| +-+-+-+-+-+                        +-+-+-+-+-+ |1|1|0|0|0|        - or -          |0|0|0|0|0| +-+-+-+-+-+                        +-+-+-+-+-+ |0|0|0|0|0|                        |0|0|0|0|0| +-+-+-+-+-+                        +-+-+-+-+-+ |0|0|0|0|0|                        |0|0|0|0|0| +-+-+-+-+-+                        +-+-+-+-+-+ </code></pre>   i ve developed some code to check if any of the 8 potential neighbor cells fall outside of the grid. however <strong>when i run my code only about half of the neighbor cells are being checked</strong>.    i am using <em>enumerate()</em> to check each of 8 potential neighbor cells  which have been stored in a list as tuples  e.g. the theoretical neighbors of (0 1) are contained in the list [(-1  0)  (-1  1)  (-1  2)  (0  0)  (0  2)  (1  0)  (1  1)  (1  2)]. however i want to get rid of any coordinate pairs with negative values or values which exceed the dimensions of the grid.    my code:   <pre><code>import sys import os import numpy from numpy import *      define nearest neighbors matrix with numpy     k = 1 x_index  y_index = mgrid[-k:k+1 -k:k+1] ## discount the center (0 0) index center = (x_index==0) &amp; (y_index==0) x_index = x_index[~center] y_index = y_index[~center] ## credit for this clever solution goes to user hooked on stackoverflow ## http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9245898/listing-adjacent-cells  def get_neighbors(raster row col):     ## pass neighbor cell coordinates to list object as tuples     neighbor_coords = zip(x_index+col y_index+row)     print neighbor_coords  \n      for pos cell in enumerate(neighbor_coords):         print  \n  cell         x = neighbor_coords[pos][0]         y = neighbor_coords[pos][1]         if (x &lt; 0 or x+1 &gt; len(raster)) or (y &lt; 0 or y+1 &gt; len(raster[0])):             print  point ({} {}) is out of range. .format(x y)             del neighbor_coords[pos]     print  \n  neighbor_coords  \n  #   neighbor_values = raster[x_index+row y_index+col]     ## pass neighbor cell values to list object     neighbor_values = raster[[i[0] for i in neighbor_coords] [i[1] for i in neighbor_coords]]     return neighbor_values  print  \n\n\n    a = random.random((5 5)) get_neighbors(a 0 0) print  \n\n\n  get_neighbors(a 1 1) </code></pre>   notice that cells only get skipped when inputting a point that falls somewhere on the edge of the grid.,python

merge two list with some order rule in python  i don t know how to give an accurate title  but here s the problem.    the problem:    i want to give a ranking list (imagine some top list) with some position preserved already.    say i got 7 slots <code>[1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8]</code> and some has already preserved postion 1  3  4  7  9. (as we only have 8 slots  the perserved postion 9 will means the last slot.)    then i have 2  5  6 slots left  which i have to fill them with other objects.    the simplified question:    i have two list:   <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [1  3  4  7  9] &gt;&gt;&gt; b = [object_x  object_y  object_z] </code></pre>   and i want to merge them to this:   <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; c = [1  object_x  3  4  object_y  object_z  7  9] </code></pre>   (we can take the  object_x  here as 0.)    that s it  just want to see if there is an elegant way to implement this.

2 codes work  the third doesn t  beginner here. :)    so i want to achieve is this:    user enters a number. it spits out the ^3 of the number. if user enters a letter instead  it prints out a error message.    code #1 works great:   <pre><code>def thirdpower(): try:     number = int(raw_input( enter a number :  ))     n=number**3     print  %d to the 3rd power is %d  % (number n) except valueerror:     print  you must enter an integer  please try again.      thirdpower()  thirdpower() </code></pre>   but i want to try doing the same thing with a <code>while</code> statement since i want to practice with it. i know its a bit more verbose this way  but i think it s good practice nonetheless.   <pre><code>number=raw_input( please enter an integer ) while number.isalpha():     print  you have entered letter. please try again      number=raw_input( please enter an integer )  n=int(number)**3 print  %d to the 3rd power is %d  %(int(number)  n) </code></pre>   my question is this. if i remove the <code>number=raw_input( please enter an integer )</code> under the <code>while</code> statement and replace it with a <code>break</code>  the code doesn t work.    here is what i mean:   <pre><code>number=raw_input( please enter an integer ) while number.isalpha():     print  you have entered letter. please try again      break #this break here ruins everything :(  n=int(number)**3 print  %d to the 3rd power is %d  %(int(number)  n) </code></pre>   can anyone explain why,python

different response if data is inputted more than once  i m new to python. i am trying to create a script that gives me a different response when the same data is inputted more than once. the code goes like this :   <pre><code>def loop() :     repeat = 0     response = raw_input( enter something :  )     if response ==  hi          repeat += 1         print  hello          loop()         if repeat &gt; 2 :             print  you have already said hi              loop()   def main() :     loop()     raw_input()  main() </code></pre>   the above code doesn t work. preferably i would like a statement that checks both conditions  but i m not quite sure how this could be done.,python

how can i find the position of one element in a sentence compared to a same element   this sounds very strange  let me explain. i would like to know how i can find the positions of a word if it is shared by two different lists in python. for example:   <pre><code>a =[i am using the internet] b =[are you using a desktop] </code></pre>   it should be able to tell me positions 2 (from the first list  it just happens that s the position of it in both if them). i can see if any words are shared but i don t know how to find the position:   <pre><code>if any(x in a for x in b): </code></pre>   yet i cannot get this line to tell me the position of it. i know this is incredible simple  my friend is teaching me how to code.,python

trying to find specific words from all files in a directory using python  i have almost 200 files in a directory and i am looking for specific  words such as <code>username</code>  <code>pin</code>  and <code>schema</code> in these 200 files. the question is how can i improve the below script to look for the words from all the files in the directory. my current script can search for words from only one file and add line numbers. below is my script:   <pre><code>from os import system  listdir path import time system( cls ) system( color b9 ) with open( c:\users\ilan\desktop\kobi.txt ) as filee: for line in filee:     for word in line.split():         if word.lower() == user  or word.lower()== password  or word.lower()== username  or word.lower()== pass  or word.lower()== secret  or word.lower()== key  or word.lower()== backdoor  or word.lower()== ip :                 file=open( coder.txt   a )                 file.write(word +  \n  )                 #count =1                 #file.write(str(count)+word +  \n  )                 #count+=1                 file.close() </code></pre>,python

python. how to find whether a text contains zero.   i want to check in a piece of text whether that text contains  0  or not.    i cannot use string.__contains(  0 ) as this is bad coding  or if i can use this  i do not have enough points to back to my senior  that this is the only way. or if you can let me know some points     the other way we found out is to extract from each row  and extract the no. from it  convert it into integer and then check if the value is greater than 0. but this is little time consuming.    the string could contain a no like 2560 which should be ignored in this search.    please tell me some alternative. i donot want that integer conversion.    please help.    for e.g.   <pre><code>abc : 1234 def : 1230  &gt;&gt;&gt; this kind of text should return false  abc : 1234 def : 0  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this kind of text should return true  as it contains 0. </code></pre>   hope you understand my problem  thanks,python

get intermediate value in python   i m trying to write a python <code>sys.excepthook</code> which  in addition to printing out the stack trace for the code as you wrote it  also prints out the <code>repr</code> for each evaluated value.    for example  if i ran the following code:   <pre><code>def greeting():     return  hello   def name():     return  greeting() + name() </code></pre>   instead of just printing out:   <pre><code>traceback (most recent call last):     file  &lt;stdin&gt;   line 1  in &lt;module&gt;         greeting() + name() typeerror: cannot concatenate  str  and  nonetype  objects </code></pre>   it would also print out <code> hello  + none</code> so i can immediately see which value was invalid and know the right area of the code to look in (obviously this is a very simple example).    i know that the cpu needs to store these intermediate values in some temporary registers... i suspect that internally python has to do something similar and i m hoping that there s some way i can access those temporary values  possibly through the <code>inspect</code> module or something similar.,python

unpacking list values to a text  i a list  that i want to unpack to a part of text.  the goal is eventually exporting the text to a txt file and then to use vpn to implement it to our database.     the text is this:   <pre><code>  name :  ----       lei :          parentid :  0       status :  active       type :  1       country :  ----       region :  1       address :  ----       domains :  none   </code></pre>   it started from a dataframe that i turned into a list  so basically each value in each of the lists is correlated to the same one with the same index in the other lists.    the goal is to have 318 texts like the one i wrote that each text will have the 3 values.    the lists are - <code> name </code>  <code> country </code>  <code> address </code>    i thought of using map with a for loop but i m not so sure how to make that happen.     any suggestions,python
timer issue in python/pygame game  i am relatively new to python. i have been modifying this game code and included a start screen etc. the problem i m having is that when the game ends i am trying to have it start again when a user inputs y at 12. i have got the key press down but there seems to be an issue with the timer. in 6.4 it is using get.ticks() but i can t seem to reinitialize this timer when the game restarts. 6.4 is used to draw and count down the clock. then further down in 10 it does a comparison for a win/loose check which then leads onto 11 which determines whether a win/loose display is shown. the game is meant to only have a 90 second time limit and then restart when the game re-initializes (ie player selects y at 12). (i have set it to 9 seconds for debugging). the health side of the game works but again the timer is effected when the game restarts. please help if you can. see code below.   <pre><code># 1 - import library import pygame from pygame.locals import * import math import random import time import sys   # 2 -

create seperate data frames and plots with a for loop  i m trying to automate pivot table creation so i can make multiple pivot tables at once. i would also like to graph these with a <code>sns.heatmap()</code> plot.    the code i have so far technically works but i m forced to use a <code>print</code> command so the data doesn t come out in a data frame and the graph the is produced is extremely unreadable.    <pre><code>for i in list(df):  y = pd.pivot_table(df  index = df[i]  values=vector) print(y) </code></pre>   this doesn t give the desired result of an individual data frame for each loop of the loop.    if i graph this with the code:   <pre><code>for i in list(df):  y = pd.pivot_table(df  index = df[i]  values=vector) sns.heatmap(y  annot=true) </code></pre>   i get all the tables mushed into one long one with a n different heat map legends.     i ve tried using dictionaries to get around this but i don t think this is the best approach (but what do i know )   <pre><code>d={} for i in list(df):      d[i] = pd.pivot_table(df  index = df[i]  values=vector)        </code></pre>   any one have any tips,python

i need to use a function in order to get a return instead printing the output  a catering company has hired you to help with organizing and preparing customer s orders. you are given a list of each customer s desired items  and must write a program that will count the number of each items needed for the chefs to prepare. the items that a customer can order are: salad  hamburger  and water.    write a function called item_order that takes as input a string named order. the string contains only words for the items the customer can order separated by one space. the function returns a string that counts the number of each item and consolidates them in the following order: salad:[# salad] hamburger:[# hambruger] water:[# water]     if an order does not contain an item  then the count for that item is 0.     notice that each item is formatted as [name of the item][a colon symbol][count of the item] and all item groups are separated by a space.    for example:    â€¢ if order =  salad water hamburger salad hamburger  then the function returns  salad:2 hamburger:2 water:1  â€¢ if order =  hamburger water hamburger  then the function returns  salad:0 hamburger:2 water:1     this is the code so far:   <pre><code>s =   hamburger water hamburger water salad    #the value of s will be received by the user only with the options in s  subs =  salad   count =0 flag=true start=0 while flag:     a = s.find(subs start)        if a==-1:                   flag=false     else:                        count+=1                 start=a+1 if count==0:     salad= salad:0  else:             b=str(count)            c=subs+ :          salad=c+b    subs =  water   count =0 flag=true start=0 while flag:     a = s.find(subs start)        if a==-1:                   flag=false     else:                        count+=1                 start=a+1 if count==0:     water= water:0  else:                b=str(count)            c=subs+ :          water=c+b     subs =  hamburger    count =0 flag=true start=0 while flag:     a = s.find(subs start)        if a==-1:                   flag=false     else:                        count+=1                 start=a+1 if count==0:     hamburger= hamburger:0  else:         b=str(count)            c=subs+ :          hamburger=c+b    print salad hamburger water </code></pre>,python

calculating bmi through python: take 2  sorry about my previous question. the question i have to answer is this:    body mass index (bmi) is a good indicator of body fatness for most people. the formula for bmi is weight/ height2 where weight is in kilograms and height is in meters. write a program that prompts for weight in pounds and height in inches  converts the values to metric  and then calculates and displays the bmi value.    what i have so far is this:    <pre><code>    bmi calculator  1. obtain weight in pounds and height in inches 2. convert weight to kilograms and height to meters 3. calculate bmi with the formula weight/height^2      #prompt user for input from keyboard weight= input ( how much do you weigh (in pounds)  ) #this get s the person s weight in pounds  weight_in_kg= weight/2.2 #this converts weight to kilograms  height= input ( what is your height (in inches)  ) #this gets the person s height in inches  height_in_meter=height*2.54 #this converts height to meters  bmi=weight_in_kg/(height_in_meters*2) #this calculates bmi  print (bmi) </code></pre>   my first step works  but that is the easy part. i know  that in python the equal sign assigns something  so i m not sure if that is the problem  but i really do not know what to do. i am really sorry. when i run the program it says:    typeerror : unsupported operand type(s) for /:  str  and  float     if anyone could give me any tips on what i am doing wrong  i would really appreciate it. and if not  thank you for your time. thanks again.,python

can one mimic lexical scoping with context managers   in an <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14986856 >earlier post</a> i asked about ways to avoid the intermediate <code>tmp</code> variable in patterns like:   <pre><code>tmp = &lt;some operation&gt; result = tmp[&lt;boolean expression&gt;] del tmp </code></pre>   ...where <code>tmp</code> is a pandas object.  for example:   <pre><code>tmp = df.xs( a )[ ii ] - df.xs( b )[ ii ] result = tmp[tmp &lt; 0] del tmp </code></pre>   the bee in my bonnet about this pattern basically comes from a longing for honest-to-goodness lexical scoping<sup>1</sup> that just won t die  even after years of programming python.  in python<sup>2</sup> i make do with explicit calls to <code>del</code>      it occurs to me that it <em>may</em> be possible to use context managers to mimic lexical scoping in python.  it would look something like this:   <pre><code>with my(df.xs( a )[ ii ] - df.xs( b )[ ii ]) as tmp:     result = tmp[tmp &lt; 0] </code></pre>   to be able to mimic lexical scoping  the context manager class would need to have a way to <code>del</code>ete the variable in the calling scope that gets assigned the value returned by its (the context manager s)  <strong>enter</strong>  method.    for example  with a generous dose of cheating:   <pre><code>import contextlib as cl  # herein lies the rub... def deletelexical():     try: del globals()[ h ]     except: pass  @cl.contextmanager def my(obj):     try: yield obj     finally: deletelexical()  with my(2+2) as h:     print h try:     print h except nameerror  e:     print  %s: %s  % (type(e).__name__  e) # 4 # name error: name  h  is not defined </code></pre>   of course  the problem is to implement <code>deletelexical</code> for real.  can it be done     edit: as abarnert pointed out  if there had been a pre-existing <code>tmp</code> in the surrounding scope  <code>deletelexical</code> would not restore it  so it could hardly be regarded as an emulation of lexical scoping.  the correct implementation would have to save any existing <code>tmp</code> variables in the surrounding scope  and replace them at the end of the with-statement.   <hr>   <sup>1</sup>e.g.  in perl  i would have coded the above with something like:   <pre><code>my $result = do {     my $tmp = $df-&gt;xs( a )[ ii ] - $df-&gt;xs( b )[ ii ];     $tmp[$tmp &lt; 0] }; </code></pre>   or in javascript:   <pre><code>var result = function () {     var tmp = df.xs( a )[ ii ] - df.xs( b )[ ii ];     return tmp[tmp &lt; 0]; }(); </code></pre>   edit: in response to abarnert s post &amp; comment: yes  in python one could define   <pre><code>def tmpfn():     tmp = df.xs( a )[ ii ] - df.xs( b )[ ii ]     return tmp[tmp &lt; 0] </code></pre>   ...and this would indeed prevent cluttering the namespace with the henceforth useless name <code>tmp</code>  but it does so by cluttering the namespace with the henceforth useless name <code>tmpfn</code>.  javascript (and perl also  btw  among others) allows <strong><em>anonymous</em></strong> functions  while python doesn t.  in any case  i consider javascript s anonymous functions as a somewhat cumbersome way to get lexical scoping; it s certainly better than nothing  and i use it heavily  but it s nowhere near as nice as perl s (and by the latter i mean not only perl s <code>do</code> statement  but also the various other ways it provides to control scope  both lexical and dynamic).    <sup>2</sup>i don t need to be reminded of the fact that only an infinitesimally small fraction of python programmers give a rat s tail about lexical scoping.,python

python 3.5 adding to dictionary and assigning a value after  so  i m taking a few courses through udemy. the final project on the python 3.x course has you making a simple ui which i did fine.     the premise is a grade tracker for students. you could add grades  remove a student  average the student grades  and exit from the program.    i wanted to do something not in the lesson  and that was be able to add new students. i added another option. i ve tried entering what i thought would work  but i keep getting errors. i could finally enter a new student  but then when i tried to add a grade for that student  it would say the student didn t exist  even though they showed up in the dictionary.    so  any clue how i can accomplish this     any and all assistance is greatly appreciated. code to follow:   <pre><code>    #making a python program  from statistics import mean as m  admins = { python : pass123@    user2 : pass2 }#this will be here authorized users and passwords would be  studentdict= { jeff :[78 88 93]                 alex :[92 76 88]                 sam :[89  92  93]}  def entergrades():     nametoenter= input( student name:  )     gradetoenter= input ( grade:  )      if nametoenter in studentdict:         print( adding grade... )         studentdict [nametoenter].append(float(gradetoenter))     else:         print ( student does not exist. )     print (studentdict)  def removestudent():     nametoremove = input ( which student do you want to remove :  )     if nametoremove in studentdict:         print( removing student... )         del studentdict[nametoremove]     print (studentdict)  def addstudent():     nametoadd = input ( enter the name of the new student:  )      if nametoadd in studentdict:         print ( student already exists. )     else:         print ( adding new student... )         studentdict[nametoadd]         print (studentdict)         #crashes upon entering student name.  def studentavgs():     for eachstudent in studentdict:         gradelist= studentdict[eachstudent]         avggrade = m(gradelist)          print(eachstudent   has an average grade of   avggrade)   def main():     print(        welcome to grade central      [1] - enter grades     [2] - remove student     [3] - add student     [4] - student average grades     [5] - exit        )     action= input ( what would you like to do today  (enter a number)  )      if action ==  1 :         entergrades()     elif action ==  2 :         removestudent()     elif action ==  3 :         addstudent()     elif action ==  4 :         studentavgs()     elif action ==  5 :         exit()     else:         print ( no valid choice was given  try again )    login= input( username:  ) passw= input( password:  )  if login in admins:     if admins[login] == passw:         print( welcome   login)         while true:             main()     else:         print( invalid password  will detonate in 5 seconds ) else:     print ( invalid username  calling the fbi to report this ) </code></pre>,python

python split a list into n groups in all possible combinations of group length and elements within group  i want to split a list into n groups in all possible combinations (allowing for variable group length).     say  i have the following list:   <pre><code>lst=[1 2 3 4] </code></pre>   if i specify n=2  the list could be divided either into groups of 1 element-3 elements or 2 elements-2 elements. within those two ways of splitting the list  there are unique combinations of which elements go in each list.     with n=2  these would be:   <pre><code>(1) (2 3 4) (2) (1 3 4) (3) (1 2 4) (4) (1 2 3) (1 2) (3 4) (1 3) (2 4) (1 4) (2 3) </code></pre>   with n=1 these would be:   <pre><code>(1 2 3 4) </code></pre>   and with n=3 these would be:   <pre><code>(1) (2) (3 4) (1) (3) (2 4) (1) (4) (2 3) (2) (3) (1 4) (2) (4) (1 3) (3) (4) (1 2) </code></pre>   i am not interested in groups of length 0  and order within a group does not matter.    i found two similar questions  but they don t answer my question exactly.    <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5360220/how-to-split-a-list-into-pairs-in-all-possible-ways >this</a> question splits a list into all combinations where each group is of length n (i found the answer by @tokland) to be particularly useful). however  i am not looking for all groups to be of the same length.     and then the first step of <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9088321/show-all-possible-groupings-of-a-list-given-only-the-amount-of-sublists-length >this</a> question gets unique combinations of split locations to split a list into n groups. however  list order is preserved here and unique combinations of elements within these groups is not determined.    i am looking for a combination of these two questions - a list is split into n groups in all possible combinations of group length as well as combinations of elements within a group.,python

using reduce to shorten a for-loop  from an array <code>ns</code>  i d like to derive an array <code>multipliers</code> as follows:   <pre><code>ns = [3  3  6  3]  multipliers = [0]*len(ns) multipliers[0] = 1 for n in range(1 len(ns)):     multipliers[n] = multipliers[n-1] * ns[n-1] </code></pre>   the resulting array <code>multipliers</code> is <code>[1  3  9  54]</code>. my gut feeling is that it should be possible to make this code more succinct using <code>reduce</code> or another built-in function  but i don t yet see how. any ideas,python
how to get n elements of a list not contained in another one   i have two lists  of different size (either one can be larger than the other one)  with some common elements. i would like to get  <code>n</code> elements from the first list which are not in the second one.    i see two families of solutions (the example below is for <code>n=3</code>)   <pre><code>a = [i for i in range(2  10)] b = [i * 2 for i in range (1  10)] # [2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9] [2  4  6  8  10  12  14  16  18]  # solution 1: generate the whole list  then slice s1 = list(set(a) - set(b)) s2 = [i for i in a if i not in b]  for i in [s1  s2]:     print (i[:3])  # solution 2: the simple loop solution c = 0 s3 = [] for i in a:     if i not in b:         s3.append(i)         c += 1         if c == 3:             break print(s3) </code></pre>   all of the them are correct  the output is   <pre><code>[9  3  5] [3  5  7] [3  5  7] </code></pre>   (the first solution does not give the <em>first</em> 3 ones because <code>set</code> does not preserve the order - but this is ok in my case as i will have unsorted (even explicitly shuffled) lists anyway)    are there the most pythonic and reasonably optimal ones      the solution 1 first computes the difference  then slices - which i find quite inefficient (the sizes of my lists will be ~100k elements  i will be looking for the first 100 ones).     the solution 2 looks more optimal but it is ugly (which is a matter of taste  but i learned that when something looks ugly in python  it means that there are usually more pythonic solution).    i will settle for solution 2 if there are no better alternatives.,python

can you create traditional fixed length and type arrays in python   i am teaching the a level syllabus by the cambridge exam board. one typical question on the practical paper is this:   <blockquote>    in a programming language of your choice  declare an array of ten integers and then initializes it.  </blockquote>   i have this:   <pre><code>myarray = []        #create the array  for i in range(10): # initializes to 0     myarray.append(0) </code></pre>   i believe this is what most people would do in python  however  unlike pascal etc it does not strictly answer the question as the lists in python are essentially dynamic arrays with the added problem of not restricting the data type of each element. can i declare a specific size array and type  like in pascal  instead of an empty dynamic list  without any type of loop and restricts the type of the array     something like (pseudo code):   <pre><code>myarray[10] : integer </code></pre>   this is a none commercial question but an educational one.,python

how to configure python s logging module to use the formatter for multiline output   i ve configured the logging module to format log messages with:   <pre><code>...      formatters : {          verbose : {              format :  %(asctime)s [%(levelname)s]                          (%(name)s:pid=%(process)d) %(module)s(%(lineno)d):                          %(message)s          }      }  ... </code></pre>   however  when it prints an exception  it shows up like:   <pre><code>2014-02-12 14:16:20 454 [error] (app:pid=1930) main(105): catchall exception at top level. traceback (most recent call last):   file  build/bdist.linux-x86_64/egg/argh/dispatching.py   line 228  in dispatch_command     dispatch(parser  *args  **kwargs)   file  build/bdist.linux-x86_64/egg/argh/dispatching.py   line 124  in dispatch     for line in lines:   file  build/bdist.linux-x86_64/egg/argh/dispatching.py   line 200  in _execute_command     for line in result:   ...  nameerror: global name  sftp  is not defined </code></pre>   is it possible to make it run each line through the formatter  e.g. so it would output something like:   <pre><code>2014-02-12 14:16:20 454 [error] (app:pid=1930) main(105): catchall exception at top level. 2014-02-12 14:16:20 454 [error] (app:pid=1930) main(105): traceback (most recent call last): 2014-02-12 14:16:20 454 [error] (app:pid=1930) main(105):   file  build/bdist.linux-x86_64/egg/argh/dispatching.py   line 228  in dispatch_command 2014-02-12 14:16:20 454 [error] (app:pid=1930) main(105):     dispatch(parser  *args  **kwargs) 2014-02-12 14:16:20 454 [error] (app:pid=1930) main(105):   file  build/bdist.linux-x86_64/egg/argh/dispatching.py   line 124  in dispatch 2014-02-12 14:16:20 454 [error] (app:pid=1930) main(105):     for line in lines: 2014-02-12 14:16:20 454 [error] (app:pid=1930) main(105):   file  build/bdist.linux-x86_64/egg/argh/dispatching.py   line 200  in _execute_command 2014-02-12 14:16:20 454 [error] (app:pid=1930) main(105):     for line in result: 2014-02-12 14:16:20 454 [error] (app:pid=1930) main(105):   ...  2014-02-12 14:16:20 454 [error] (app:pid=1930) main(105): nameerror: global name  sftp  is not defined </code></pre>,python

html to text conversion using python language  i d like to extract the text from an html file using python. i want essentially the same output i would get if i copied the text from a browser and pasted it into notepad.    i d like something more robust than using regular expressions that may fail on poorly formed html. i ve seen many people recommend beautiful soup  but i ve had a few problems using it. for one  it picked up unwanted text  such as javascript source. also  it did not interpret html entities. for example  i would expect <code>&amp;#39;</code> in html source to be converted to an apostrophe in text  just as if i d pasted the browser content into notepad.    update: <code>html2text</code> looks promising. it handles html entities correctly and ignores javascript. however  it does not exactly produce plain text; it produces markdown that would then have to be turned into plain text. it comes with no examples or documentation  but the code looks clean.,python

how do i break a loop inside of a loop in python   this code is a loop which reviews vocabulary words. for some reason  my break isn t working.    here are my words that this program uses:   <pre><code>vocab ={ adherent  :  a person who follows or upholds a leader  cause  etc.; supporter; follower.    incoherent  :  without logical or meaningful connection; disjointed; rambling    inherent  :  existing in someone or something as a permanent and inseparable element  quality  or attribute     diffuseadj  :  characterized by great length or discursiveness in speech or writing; wordy } </code></pre>   here is my loop:   <pre><code>while 1:     ques1= raw_input( would you like a list of the vocabulary words  or would you like to play a game  type  words  or  game :  )     if ques1 ==  words :           ques11= raw_input( type  w  for words only  type  wd  for words and definitions  type  d  for definitions only:  )         if ques11 ==  w :             for key value in vocab.iteritems():                 print key         elif ques11 ==  wd :             for key value in vocab.iteritems():                 print key  -   value         elif ques11 ==  d :             for key value in vocab.iteritems():                 print value     elif ques1 ==  game :         game=raw_input( type  rw  for random words:  )         if game ==  rw :             while 1:                 y = random.choice(vocab.keys())                 print y                 t2=raw_input( what is the definition :  )                 if t2 in vocab[y]:                     print  all those words were in the definition!                      print vocab[y]                 elif t2 not in vocab[y]:                     print vocab[y]                 elif t2 ==  menu : break                 raw_input( hit  enter :  )              else:         raw_input( hit  enter :  ) </code></pre>   for some reason the break for the game loop doesn t return to the  ques1 . why won t this break work,python
run python module without the pyc extension  i have a compiled python 2.6 program on linux called abc.pyc. if i run    <pre><code>./abc.pyc </code></pre>   it runs fine. however if i rename it to abc (i.e  without the pyc extension) it fails to run. it gives the error message:   <pre><code>importerror: no module named abc </code></pre>   how can i run my program without the .pyc extension     <strong>updated:</strong> i want to run the compiled (pyc) version not the py version    alternatively  i know i can compile modules to .so files using cython  but can i compile my main python program to something i can execute on a linux platform  if so  a cython command line example would be appreciated.    <strong>updated</strong> i ve raised the cython question as a separate question.,python

joining a server with the discord python api  i m trying to setup a discord bot with python. i have a preexisting discord server that i would like the bot to join  but i seem to be having a bear of a time getting it to actually join. i am using discord.py 0.10.0 and python 3.5.1. here s my code:   <pre><code>import discord import asyncio import logging  logging.basicconfig(level=logging.info)  client = discord.client()  @client.event async def on_ready():     print( logged in as )     print(client.user.name)     print(client.user.id)     print( ------ )     print(client)   @client.event async def on_message(message):     print(message)     if message.content.startswith( !test ):         counter = 0         tmp = await client.send_message(message.channel   calculating messages... )         async for log in client.logs_from(message.channel  limit=100):             if log.author == message.author:                 counter += 1          await client.edit_message(tmp   you have {} messages. .format(counter))     elif message.content.startswith( !sleep ):         await asyncio.sleep(5)         await client.send_message(message.channel   done sleeping )  client.run( token ) </code></pre>   note that this is essentially the basic discord.py script as given on the github page. however  i can t seem to figure out how to have it actually join my server. when inserting this line into the on_ready function:   <pre><code>server = await client.accept_invite( instantinvitecode ) </code></pre>   with instantinvitecode replaced with my actual instant invite code (i tried both discord.gg/code and code)  i get <code>discord.errors.forbidden: forbidden (status code: 403): bots cannot use this endpoint</code>. note that logging in does actually work- i get output as to my username and id.     also note that i registered with the discord api and registered as a bot- that is the token that i am using.,python

why use both os.path.abspath and os.path.realpath  in multiple open source projects  i have seen people do <code>os.path.abspath(os.path.realpath(__file__))</code> to get the absolute path to the current file. however  i find that <code>os.path.abspath(__file__)</code> and <code>os.path.realpath(__file__)</code> produce the same result. <code>os.path.abspath(os.path.realpath(__file__))</code> seems to be a bit redundant. is there a reason people are using that,python
how do i avoid error 32 while renaming a folder with python - os.rename()  i use a python script that contains the function:    <pre><code>def listdirs(folder):         return [d for d in os.listdir(folder) if os.path.isdir(os.path.join(folder  d))] </code></pre>   the function is called repeatedly to build a set of paths that are used in an operation that appends multiple copies of a dataset from individual gps units into a single database.    i want to be able to append some characters to the name of the folders whose data has been appended so that those folders can be omitted from the operation the next time the larger script is run.  my hope is that this will prevent me from having to load a bunch of redundant data into the database and then just delete it since it s not useful.    my problem is that when i attempt to call os.rename() and use it to  tag  the folders involved the code fails and i get:   <blockquote>    windowserror: [error 32] the process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process  </blockquote>   it is not my intention for the folder to be seen as  in use  at this point - what do i need to do to get the folders to a state where i can rename them,python

python logging: print message only once  i m using the <code>logging</code> module in python 3  and want a particular warning message to be displayed only once. the problem is that the check is inside a loop:   <pre><code>def canned_example():     logger.warning( this function hasn t been created yet )   for i in range(10):     canned_example() </code></pre>   is there a flag to set inside the logging module that will denote that this particular warning is only to be displayed once  the alternative is to keep a record of different flags  but i d like to keep it simple if possible.    <strong>update:</strong> amir yazdanbakhsh has posted an answer in the comments that allows us to do this for all messages. ideally  i d like some per-message flag:   <pre><code>def canned_example():     logger.warning( this function hasn t been created yet   norepeat=true)   for i in range(10):     canned_example() </code></pre>,python

python filter() and sort() taking too long  i am fairly new to python and utilized it for a script to open a folder  filter only to files and then sort them in descending order based on modified time. after this the script starts at the first log file and searches for any line that contains the word  failure   also keeping a count of how many it finds each time. it then writes this info to a separate file.    the issue i m having is that this script is taking 20-30 mins to run. the folder contains 5k+ files  however it does not have to iterate through all of them. the script stores on a separate file the first file it touched the last time it ran  and stops processing once it hits the file again.    where i am finding the script is taking too long is on using the built in <code>filter()</code> and <code>sort()</code> methods. can anyone offer reasons as to why it is so slow  and perhaps offer a solution    <pre><code>os.chdir(path) files = filter(os.path.isfile  os.listdir(prod_path)) files.sort(key = os.path.getmtime  reverse = true)  for file in files:     if file == break_file:             break     f = open(path + file).readlines()     count = 0 #set count of errors to 0     dest.write( upload:   + file[:file.index( . )] +  \n ) #filename  need to truncate off filetype     for line in f: #for each line in the the list of lines read from file         if line.find( failure ) != -1 and line != f[0]:             dest.write(line +  \n )             count += 1     dest.write( number of errors:   + str(count) +  \n\n )  if dest.tell() == 0:     dest.write( no files to process! ) dest.close() update_file = open(last_run_file   w ) #last_run_file stores break_file update_file.write(str(files[0])) print  done      </code></pre>,python

how to create a nested data structure in python   since i recently started a new project  i m stuck in the  think before you code  phase. i ve always done basic coding  but i really think i now need to carefully plan how i should organize the results that are produced by my script.    it s essentially quite simple: i have a bunch of satellite data i m extracting from google earth engine  including different sensors  different acquisition modes  etc. what i would like to do is to loop through a list of  sensor-acquisition_mode  couples  request the data  do some more processing  and finally save it to a variable or file.    suppose i have the following example:   <pre><code>sensors = [ landsat   sentinel1 ] sentinel_modes = [ ascending   descending ] sentinel_polarization = [ vv   vh ] </code></pre>   in the end  i would like to have some sort of nested data structure that at the highest level has the elements  landsat  and  sentinel1 ; under  landsat  i would have a time and values matrix; under  sentinel1  i would have the different modes and then as well the data matrices.    i ve been thinking about lists  dictionaries or classes with attributes  but i really can t make up my mind  also since i don t have that much of experience.  at this stage  a little help in the right direction would be much appreciated!,python

python iteration too fast   i have a really annoying problem with python. essentially  i am creating a dynamic multiplayer system in python for blender 3d ge. because of the nature of the problem  it is not a blender issue. here is what i am doing:   <ol> <li>looping through a list of client s to get each one s data to get data</li> <li>looping through another dict in that client s data to get type</li> <li>looping through that dict (type) to get id</li> </ol>   here is an example of data:   <pre><code>    [ a1a1a4    name13  { position : {7316: [[-0.23014163970947266  7.419361591339111  -1.518202424049774]   sphere    cube ]}}]     [ a1a1a4    name16  { position : {5982: [[-0.23014163970947266  4.099361419677734  -1.518202424049774]   sphere    cube ]}}]     [ a1a1a4    name90  { position : {7858: [[-0.23014163970947266  4.659361362457275  -1.518202424049774]   sphere    cube ]}}] </code></pre>   here is the processing code   <pre><code>    for set in data: # for each packaged set of data         print(set)         client_status = set[0]         client_id = set[1]         if client_status ==  a1a1a4 :              client_dic = set[2]             if client_id == gd[ player_name ]:                 continue              if client_id not in gd[ registered_client_objects ]:                 gd[ registered_client_objects ][client_id] = {}                 continue                 #for each type in the client dic                 for type in [i for i in client_dic if i == self.plugin_type]:                  #if relevant to current plugin                 if type in  gd[ registered_client_objects ][client_id]:                      #for the id of each plugin of this type sent from the client                     for id in client_dic[type]:                          #if the sender plugin isn t registered:                         if not id in gd[ registered_client_objects ][client_id][type]:                             #creates a plugin listener for that sender                                                       create_plugin(client_dic[type] id type client_id)                            else:                             use_data(client_dic[type] id client_id type)                  else:                     gd[ registered_client_objects ][client_id][type] = {}         elif client_status ==  a1a1a5 :             remove_plugin(client_id)        </code></pre>   the end result is i use the id to match some settings and retreive the appropriate item to apply some data on. the important part is  use data  which processes the data this works fine with two clients  but any more and the game objects start to jitter. i think this means that i am assigning the data (position) to them too fast.  the script runs 60 times a second  but because of the iterations within  i can assume that the iterations are the issue  as i receive no lag. therefore: how can i slow down an iteration,python

removing tuples in a list  i have these lists:   <pre><code>sqvaluelist = [] valuelist = [(10.5 )  (20.5 )  (21.5 )  (70.0 )  (34.5 )] </code></pre>   i want to apply this code on the valuelist:   <pre><code>for value in valuelist:     valuesquared = value*value     sqvaluelist.append(valuesquared ) </code></pre>   but i received this error:   <pre> typeerror: can t multiply sequence by non-int of type  tuple  </pre>   i think i know the reason behind this error  it is because every value is inside a separate tuple.     my question is  is there any way to take this values off their respective tuple  and just turn them into a list like   <pre><code>valuelist = [10.5  20.5  21.5  70.0  34.5] </code></pre>   without manually editing the structure of the existing list so that the for loop can be executed     edit: i apologize! they are actually tuples! added commas after each value. sorry!,python

hotter/colder number game in python  i m working my way through the code academy python course and have been trying to build small side projects to help reinforce the lessons.     i m currently working on a number game. i want the program to select a random number between 1 and 10 and the user to input a guess.     then the program will return a message saying you win or a prompt to pick another higher/lower number.     my code is listed below. i can t get it to reiterate the process with the second user input.     <strong>i don t really want an answer  just a hint.</strong>   <pre><code>import random random.seed()  print  play the number game!  x = raw_input( enter a whole number between 1 and 10: ) y = random.randrange(1  10  1)  #add for loop in here to make the game repeat until correct guess  if x == y:     print  you win.      print  your number was    x    and my number was    y elif x &gt; y:     x = raw_input( your number was too high  pick a lower one:  ) elif x &lt; y:     x = raw_input( your number was too low  pick a higher one:  ) </code></pre>,python

change delimiter on  for each  loops on strings in python  i need to read an input text file in python  by streaming line by line. that means load the text file line by line instead of all at once into memory. but my line delimiters are not whitespaces  they are arbitrary characters.    here is a method on stack overflow for loading files line by line:   <pre><code>with open( log.txt ) as infile:     for line in infile:         do_something_with(line) </code></pre>   the above is perfect  however i need to change the delimiter from whitespaces to a different character.    how can this be done  thank you.,python

python dictionary optimize this script  i have a string like <code>rdb_master_mongodb</code> where <code>rdb_</code> is fixed and <code>master</code> is a database name which can be anything and <code>mongodb</code> can be one among <code>mysql</code>  <code>mongodb</code>  <code>postgres</code>  <code>mssql</code> or <code>bdb</code>. i need to fetch the value for this string from the dictionary which has the value in <code>mydict[master][mongodb]</code>. in order to get this i need to split the string <code>rdb_master_mongodb</code> and get the values of <code>master</code> and <code>mongodb</code>. i can t use split because sometimes the string becomes <code>rdb_master_test_mongodb</code>. hence i have to use <code>endswith</code> to get the exact key. howeveer  <code>endswith</code> does not work on a list.    i have to get the matching tuple value from a tuple. right now i do this like:   <pre><code>import re  name =  rdb_master_mongodb  s = re.sub( rdb_       name) valid_db = ( mysql    postgres    mongodb    mssql    bdb ) (a  b  c  d  e) = valid_db if s.endswith(a):    db = a if s.endswith(b):   db = b if s.endswith(c):   db = c if s.endswith(d):   db = d if s.endswith(e):   db = e db_name = re.sub( _ +db      s) print db_name+  is  +db </code></pre>   is there a better way to do this,python
calculating the substrings of a string in python  i have a simple string  abc . now i have to write python code for creating all possible unique substrings  except the empty string  from this string.    the answer should be as follows: a b c ab ac bc abc    i wrote something like this :   <pre><code>def getsubstrings(str):     sub = []     length = len(str)     for i in range(length):         for j in range(i length):             sub.append(str[i:j+1])     sub.sort()     return sub  str =  abc  print (getsubstrings(str)) </code></pre>   but this is probably the wrong way   since it is not giving expected results.    can someone please help me with an efficient solution.    thanks in advance.,python

running lines of code inside code for new thread instead of specifying a target function to run  i ve tried a lot of searching but didn t really know how to word my problem  so it may be that there s a solution that i couldn t find because i didn t know how to search for it.    i have a single line of code that i d like to run in a separate thread. so far i have the impression that to create a new thread you have to put the code you want to run inside its own function and then call that function using the <code>target</code> argument when starting the thread:   <pre><code>threading.thread(target = functionname).start() </code></pre>   this is fine and i have it working like this  however because i m only running a single line of code it seems a bit pointless to have it in its own function  and i d like to get rid of this. i want to create the thread and effectively specify the actual line of code itself as the <code>target</code> instead of the function name.    i can do this in c#:   <pre><code>new thread(delegate() {     // any amount of code goes here and it will be run in its own thread }).start(); </code></pre>   but is there any way i can do this in python,python
converting kilometers to mph in python  just a quick question on this code that i am trying to understand.     for the last line of this code i don t understand why there is a 0.3f in the print statement. the  %  makes sense because the variable kilometers and miles is being inserted inside the statement but  the 0.3f has me kind of lost.   <pre><code># program to convert kilometers into miles  # input is provided by the user in kilometers  # take input from the user kilometers = float(input( how many kilometers :  ))  # conversion factor conv_fac = 0.621371  # calculate miles miles = kilometers * conv_fac print( %0.3f kilometers is equal to %0.3f miles  %(kilometers miles)) </code></pre>,python

converting text file to list  we had our customer details spread over 4 legacy systems and have subsequently migrated all the data into 1 new system.     our customers previously had different account numbers in each system and i need to check which account number has been used in the new system  which supports api calls.    i have a text file containing all the possible account numbers  structured like this:   <pre><code>30000001  30000002  30000003  30000004 30010000  30110000  30120000  30130000 34000000  33000000  32000000  31000000 </code></pre>   where each row represents all the old account numbers for each customer.     i m not sure if this is the best approach but i want to open the text file and create a nested list:   <pre><code>[[ 30000001    30000002    30000003    30000004 ]  [ 30010000    30110000    30120000    30130000 ]  [ 34000000    33000000    32000000    31000000 ]] </code></pre>   then i want to iterate over each list but to save on api calls  as soon as i have verified the new account number in a particular list  i want to break out and move onto the next list.   <pre><code>import json from urllib2 import urlopen  def read_file():     lines = [line.rstrip( \n ) for line in open( customers.txt    r )]     return lines  def verify_account(*customers):     verified_accounts = []     for accounts in customers:         for account in accounts:             url = api_url + account             response = json.load(urlopen(url))             if response[ account_status ] == 1:                 verified_accounts.append(account)                 break      return verified_accounts </code></pre>   the main issue is when i read from the file it returns the data like below so i can t iterate over the individual accounts.    <pre><code>[ 30000001  30000002  30000003  30000004    30010000  30110000  30120000  30130000    34000000  33000000  32000000  31000000 ] </code></pre>   also  is there a more pythonic way of using list comprehensions or similar to iterate and check the account numbers. there seems to be too much nesting being used for python     the final item to mention is that there are over 255 customers to check  well there is almost 1000. will i be able to pass more than 255 parameters into a function,python

how can i  reconstruct  the background of an image with python   how can i  reconstruct  the background of an image with python  i mean  if there are several objects in front of the same background  how can i isolate that background using those images to like  take the objects away  from it     the description of my project is:  there s a way to rescue the background image from a photo. for example  retrieve the backdrop where a person is walking. this is achieved by analyzing several photos that share the same background. once these pictures are analyzed  you can delete the image that keeps the background image to be shown. this project aims to build a program that reads a finite set of images (in ppm format) and then analyzes the images in order to obtain the background image.     does anyone know if this has a specific name to investigate  does anyone have any information about this,python

( usually less than 4 ) and only up to 4 distinct values will be used across the columns.    i am looking to return up to 4 rows  where each row in the resulting set is basically a column value where the value is selected left from right starting at the top preserving col number. if another row has a value that is not column unique it is shifted to the next available column.    examples:    if i have:   <pre><code>id  col1  col2  col3  col4   0   a     b           c   1               d     </code></pre>   i would like to return   <pre><code>a   b   d   c </code></pre>   and   <pre><code>id  col1  col2  col3  col4   0   a     b     d        1   c                 </code></pre>   gives   <pre><code>a   b   d   c  </code></pre>   and   <pre><code>id  col1  col2  col3  col4   0   a     b     d        1   c                   2   c                 </code></pre>   gives   <pre><code>a   b   d   c  </code></pre>   thanks!  the scenario when there are non unique columns and spaces between values can be thrown out.<br> this will not happen:   <pre><code>a b  d c    </code></pre>   this might help:   <pre><code>create table #original ( id int  a int  b int  c int  d int );  insert into #original --select 0 1 2 null 4 --union  --select 1 null null 3 null -- -- --select 0 1 2 3 null --union  --select 1 4 null null null -- -- select 0 1 2 4 null union  select 1 3 null null null  union  select 2 3 null null null   select * from #original order by id asc;  with cteoriginal as (     select *  rank() over (partition by [sortorder] order by id asc) as [nonuniquesortorder]     from     (         select id  a as [value]  1 as [sortorder]         from #original         where a is not null         union all         select id  b as [value]  2 as [sortorder]         from #original         where b is not null         union all         select id  c as [value]  3 as [sortorder]         from #original         where c is not null         union all         select id  d as [value]  4 as [sortorder]         from #original         where d is not null     ) as temp )  select [value] from ( select top 50 [value]  ((([nonuniquesortorder] - 1) * 4) + [sortorder]) sortedorder from cteoriginal order by sortedorder ) tmp group by [value] order by min(sortedorder)  drop table #original </code></pre>,sql

storing search results for future use  i have the following scenario where the search returns a list of userid  values (1 2 3 4 5 6... etc.) if the search were to be run again  the results are guaranteed to change given some time. however i need to stored the instance of the search results to be used in the future.    we have a current implementation (legacy)  which creates a record for the search_id with the  criteria and inserts every row returned into a different table with the associated search_id.   <pre><code>table search_results    search_id unsigned int fk  pk (clustered index)    user_id unsigned int fk </code></pre>   this is an unacceptable approach as this table has grown onto millions of records. i ve considered partitioning the table  but either i will have numerous partitions (1000s).     i ve optimized the existing tables that search results expired unless they re used elsewhere  so all the search results are referenced elsewhere.    in the current schema  i cannot store the results as serialized arrays or xml. i am looking to efficiently store the search result information  such that it can be efficiently accessed later without being burdened by the number of records.     edit: thank you for the answers  i don t have any problems running the searches themselves  but the result set for the search gets used in this case for recipient lists  which will be used over and over again  the purpose of storing is exactly to have a snapshot of the data at the given time.,sql

how can i keep my records grouped together using sql   suppose i have a game table with the following fields    match_id  user_id  result    the results always come in pairs with identical match_id.  so for example   <pre><code>1837  4  win 1837  29  forfeit </code></pre>   i would like to separate into two groups  one group that has results and one group that doesn t.  this is pretty easily done by using <code>where result &lt;&gt;   </code>    however i ve noticed a few strange records such as the following   <pre><code>1839  5  win 1839  40  </code></pre>   the second record does not have a result recorded against it.  therefore using <code>result &lt;&gt;   </code> puts splits match 1839 into two separate groups whereas i want them to stay together.  can i achieve this in sql     so basically my pseudo code is:    if both have a result first group    if either have the result first group    if none have a result second group    full code using mysql   <pre><code>sql1: select * from game where result &lt;&gt;    </code></pre>   gives    <pre><code>1837  4  win 1837  29  forfeit 1839  5  win   sql2: select * from game where result =     1839  40  1850  30  1850  5  </code></pre>   i m looking for    sql1:      <pre><code>1837  4  win 1837  29  forfeit 1839  5  win 1839  40  </code></pre>   sql2:      <pre><code>1850  30  1850  5  </code></pre>,sql

sql count of related products via foreign key  we need to build a tree view with the group structure and a count of all the products that fit into each level below it like:   <pre><code>1 - drink related (120) &gt; 11 - plastic cups (70)   &gt; 111 - vending machine cups (20)      &gt; 1111 - vending machine cups 100-150cc (12)         o cup 1         o cup 2         etc..   &gt; 112 - party cups (25)   &gt; 113 - childrens cups (25) &gt; 12 - paper cups (50) 2 - food related (198) &gt; 21 - plastic plates (75) etc... </code></pre>   so  we have two tables. one holds products  one holds a group structure for the products. each product row contains only a direct foreign key link to the id of the group row it belongs to  so for example product id 42231 has a reference to group id 4 as it is a clear plastic cup of a certain size.  a product can fit in at any group level  it won t necessarily be always at the 4th group level if it doesn t fit a specific category. (so  for example  a new line of a drink cup may be dumped in group id 1  drink related  until it eventually gets its own category some months later.)    the group table (currently) has 1800 rows and basically forms a category tree. each group id is alphanumeric as some groups have too many variants to work with just numbers so:   <pre><code>id     gp1     gp2     gp3     gp4     desc 1      1       0       0       0       drink related 2      1       11      0       0       plastic cups 3      1       11      111     0       vending machine cups 4      1       11      111     1111    vending machine cups 100-150cc </code></pre>   if i only wanted to show the exact number of products in each id  i could do something like this:   <pre><code>select *  (select count(1)      from products     where groupid=g.id and isdeleted=0)      as groupproductcount  from groups g  order by g.group1  g.group2  g.group3  g.group4 </code></pre>   ...but i m after a more recursive count where it shows the count for all products below the current level so at a glance i can see there are 120 drink-related products within group 1 and not 3 which are directly in <em>group id</em> 1 at the moment.    personally i think i m going to have to get the dba to add in the 4 group levels to the product record too as otherwise for each record in the group table i d have to determine which level we re at (zeros in unused level  so a zero in group 4 means we re at level 3  zero in group 3 means we re at level 2  etc) and then scan through every product record (currently 10 000 and growing) to see if the group it falls in (read via the foreign key group id) has a level that matches the current group level record i m trying to count for.    i can t see that this can be achieved efficiently with just the group id in the product record. am i right here or am i missing something obvious,sql

sql getting count in a date range  i m looking for input on getting a count of records that were  active  in a certain date range.   <pre><code>create table member {     id int identity      name  varchar      active  bit } </code></pre>   the scenario is one where  members  number fluctuate over time. so i could have linear growth where i have 10 members at the beginning of the month and 20 at the end. currently we go off the number of currently active (as marked by an  active  flag in the db) at the time of report. - this is hardly accurate and worse  6 months from now  my  members  figure may be substantially different than now. and since i m doing averages per user  if i run a report now  and 6 months from now - the figures will probably be different.    i don t think a simple  dateactive  and  dateinactive  will do the trick... due to members coming and going and coming back etc. so:   <pre><code>joe may be active 12-1 and deactivated 12-8 and activated 12-20  so joe counts as being a  member  for 8 days and then 11 days for a total of 19 days </code></pre>   but the revolving door status of members means keeping a separate table (presumably) of userid  status  date    <pre><code>create table memberstatus {     member_id int      status bit   -- 0 for in-active  1 for active     date date } (adding this table would make the  active  field in members obsolete). </code></pre>   in order to get a  good  average members per month (or date range) - it seems i d need to get a daily average  and do an average of averages over  x  days. or is there some way in sql to do this already.     this extra  status  table would allow an accurate count going back in time. so in a case where you have a revenue or cost figure  that doesn t change or is not aggregate  it s fixed  that when you want cost/members for last june  you certainly don t want to use your current members count  you want last junes.    is this how it s done  i know it s one way  but it the  better  way...    @gordon - i got ya  but i guess i was looking at records like this:   <pre><code>members     1 joe     2 tom     3 sue  memberstatus     1 1  12-01-2014      1 0  12-08-2014      1 1  12-20-2014  </code></pre>   in this way i only need the last record for a user to get their current status  but i can track back and  know  their status on any give day.    if i m understanding your method it might look like this   <pre><code>create table memberstatus {     member_id int      active_date      inactive_date } </code></pre>   so on the 1-7th the record would look like this   <pre><code>1  12-01-2014  null </code></pre>   and on the 8th it would change to    1  12-01-2014   12-08-2014     the on the 20th   <pre><code>1  12-01-2014   12-08-2014  1  12-20-2014  null </code></pre>   although i can get the same data out  it seems more difficult without any benefit - am i missing something,sql

merging sql views  i am working for the it department of a college as a student worker and have very limited knowledge in using sql (i am not majoring in computer science/engineering). i ll try my best to describe what i want to accomplish here.    i want to create a table that includes info about new students  basically : id  first name  last name  need  exams (y/n)  course101 section  instructor.     my problem is  exchange and transfer students and also some first year students would not have to/did not sign up for course101  so using <code>where studnt_course =  course101% </code> will leave out those students. i would like to pick up those students in my view and display their course101 section  instructor values as null.     i am thinking about making two views  one for all new students  and one for students with course101 only  and do some kind of merging/union but not sure how to actually do that.     any help will be greatly appreciated!,sql

removing repeated string values  given a non-key varchar column where the string values may be repeated in many other rows  is a separate table mapping unique strings from the column to an integer a beneficial practice  it would clearly eliminate storage space  but is the performance lost from joining the first table to this mapping table worth it,sql
left join turns into inner join <pre><code>select a.foo b.bar c.foobar from tableone as a inner join tabletwo as b on a.pk = b.fk left join tablethree as c on b.pk = c.fk where a.foo =  something  and c.foobar =  somethingelse  </code></pre>   having the and clause after the where clause seems to turn the left join into an inner join. the behavior i am seeing is if there isnt  somethingelse  in tablethree there will be 0 rows returned.    if i move c.foobar =  somethingelse  into the join clause the stored join will act like a left join.    <pre><code>    select     a.foo     b.bar     c.foobar     from tableone as a     inner join tabletwo as b on a.pk = b.fk     left join tablethree as c on b.pk = c.fk     and c.foobar =  somethingelse      where a.foo =  something  </code></pre>   can someone point me at some documentation describing why this happens  thank you very much,sql

get number of occurrences taking 1 for every 3 days group  i ve got a table for employees that usually get late to work. i need to send a report to human resources showing every user that got late  taking into account that i just can count a warning per user if that user got late in a period of 3 days at least 1 time within period.    the first data i need is the total number of warnings to be sent for hr manager to evaluate global  lateness .    users that got late just one day will receive one warning  but if they got late twice or more the warnings they ll receive depend if they received a warning within a 3 days period counting from day one.    let s see with an example:   <ul> <li>joe    monday  9th</li> <li>mark   monday  9th</li> <li>tim    monday  9th</li> <li>joe    tuesday 10th</li> <li>joe   wednesday 11th</li> <li>joe    thursday 12th</li> <li>tim    friday 13th</li> </ul>   taking the data from table above as an example.    joe will receive 2 warnings: first for monday  and second for thursday. tuesday and wednesday will be discarded because they belonged to the same 3 day period.    mark will receive just one warning for monday.    tim will receive 2 warnings. first for monday and second for friday.    maybe this number is not possible to get using standard sql query and some cursors need to be done.    thanks in advance,sql

getting sql to return data only for the last business day  i have tried about a thousand different ways to attempt this after hours of scouring the internet and finding things that seem like they would work  i still have not been able to get this to come up correctly.    i have a query that i am running in sql via tableau that i need to be dynamic and change to look at only business days.  when i updated my query this morning  since our server looks at one day prior  it was looking for sunday data which in my company there is no processing going on on saturday or sunday  i need it to know when today is monday  (basically) do getdate()-3  otherwise  getdate()-1.    i have tried declaring a variable  i have tried something like this:   <pre><code>select  dateadd(day  case datename(weekday  getdate())                      when  sunday  then -2                      when  monday  then -3                      else -1 end  datediff(day  0  getdate())) </code></pre>   which doesn t work because the column from my table called create_date to be set to the correct dynamic date.  this works if i run it alone without trying to incorporate into a query (gives me the date for friday) but i can not figure out how to then take that date and apply it to my query.    this is the closest i have been able to get    <pre><code>declare @creationday date   set @creationday = day  case datename(weekday  convert(date getdate()))                     when  sunday  then -2                      when  monday  then -3                      else -1 end  datediff(day  0  getdate()));  select creation_date  count(*) from [dbo].[workflow_document] where creation_date = @creationday group by creation_date </code></pre>   but still getting an error  msg 102  level 15  state 1  line 3 incorrect syntax near    .     not sure what could be wrong with the comma  but i am about at the end of my rope with getting this to work.  anything is appreciated!,sql

sql - identify distinct values including count for all columns in a table  i want to be able to identify the distinct values including a count of the value for each column in a table.    i reviewed - <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12330686/get-distinct-records-with-counts rq=1 >get distinct records with counts</a>    and it shows me how to do this for an individual column and works great.  however  i have a table with over 600 columns  and coding each column would be incredibly time consuming.      is there a way to code my sql where i could get these same results for all columns in a table  without having to individually input each column     so to use the example from the link:   <pre><code>personid  msg   ------------- 1   msg1    2   msg2    2   msg3    3   msg4    1   msg2   </code></pre>   my results would be:   <pre><code>personid  count | msg  count ----------------------------- 1          2 |       msg1     1   2          2 |       msg2     2   3          1 |       msg3     1   _  _         |       msg4     1   </code></pre>   is this possible   i ve tried getting at it using distincts and wildcards (*) but no luck.    apologize if this isn t detailed enough  this is my first post and i m no sql expert  and googling hasn t found an answer.  thanks.,sql

sql condition based dataset  i have a sql server database that i did not design.  the employees have degrees  licensures and credentials stored in a few different tables.  i have written the query to join all of this information together so i can see an over all result of what the data looks like. i have been asked to create a view for this data that returns only the highest degree they have obtained and the two highest certifications. the problem is  as it is pre existing data  there is no hierarchy built into the data. all of the degrees and certifications are simply stored as a string associated with their employee number.  the first logical step was to create an adjacency list(i believe this is the correct term). for example  md  is the highest degree you can obtain in our list. so i have given that the  ranking  of 1. the next lower degree is  ranked  as 2. and so forth.  i can join on the text field that contains these and return their associated rank.  the problem i am having is returning only the two highest based on this ranking.  if the employee has multiple degrees or certifications they are listed on a second or third row. from a logical standpoint  i need to group the employee id  first name and last name. then some how concatenate the degrees  certifications and licensures based on the  ranking  i created for them. it is not a true hierarchy in the way that i am thinking about it because i only need to know the highest two and not necessarily the relationship between the results.    another potential caveat is that the database must remain in sql server 2000 compatibility mode.    any help that can be given would be much appreciated. thank you.   <pre><code>select a.edurank as  licensure rank      b.edurank as  degree rank      empcomp.eecempno     emppers.eepnamefirst      emppers.eepnamelast      rtrim(empeduc.efelevel)     rtrim(emplicns.elclicenseid)     a.edutype     b.edutype        from empcomp        join emppers on empcomp.eeceeid = emppers.eepeeid       join empeduc on empcomp.eeceeid = empeduc.efeeeid       join emplicns on empcomp.eeceeid = emplicns.elceeid       join yvdegreeranks a on a.educode = emplicns.elclicenseid       join yvdegreeranks b on b.educode = empeduc.efelevel </code></pre>,sql

how to write a select statement when i don t know in advance what columns i want   my application has several tables: a master object table  and several tables for storing specific kinds of objects: cat  shoe and book.    here s an idea of what the table columns look like:   <h2>object</h2>  <pre><code>object_id    (primary key) object_type  (string) </code></pre>  <h2>cat</h2>  <pre><code>cat_id       (primary key) object_id    (foreign key) name         (string) color        (string) </code></pre>  <h2>shoe</h2>  <pre><code>shoe_id      (primary key) object_id    (foreign key) model        (string) size         (string) </code></pre>  <h2>book</h2>  <pre><code>book_id      (primary key) object_id    (foreign key) title        (string) author       (string) </code></pre>   from the user s point of view  each specific object is primarily identified by its name  which is a different column for each table. for the cat table it s name  for the shoe table it s model  and for the book table it s title.    let s say i m handed an object_id without knowing in advance what kind of object it represents -- a cat  a shoe or a book.  how do i write a select statement to get this information     obviously it would look a little like this:   <pre><code>select object_type name from object where object_id = 12345; </code></pre>   but how do i get the right contents in the  name  column,sql

about dual table structure in oracle sql *plus  we know that  dual  is a temporary table which exactly contains 1 column whose name is  dummy   which is of  varchar2(1)  type that has 1 single row. the value of that record is  x . the varchar2 has size of 1 which means it should not allow more than a single character.  now my question is: if it is of varchar2 type  then why it can hold any datatype temporarily and if we insert characters more than 1 (size)  how this is possible for it (dual) to accept it   example:    <pre><code>sql&gt; desc dual   name                            null     type  ------------------------------- -------- ----  dummy                                    varchar2(1)  sql&gt; select sysdate from dual;  sysdate --------- 22-jan-13  sql&gt; select 5*5 result from dual;     result ---------        25  sql&gt; select  ankita  as  name  from dual;  name ------ ankita </code></pre>   clearly  sysdate  is of date type (not varchar2)   result  is of number type (not varchar2). also  ankita  is more than 1 single character  i.e.  6 characters. this should contradict the structure that varchar2 is holding only 1  and supporting 6 too..,sql

how to execute a query that joins parts of two existing tables and inserts it into a new table   i have a table with surveys and a table with widgets. between these two tables there should be a third table that connects the two. the following is precisely what i m looking for.   <pre><code>survey:  survey_id   numeric(18  0)  unchecked primary key dashboard_id    numeric(18  0)  unchecked foreign key survey_title    nvarchar(250)   unchecked  widget:  widget_id   numeric(18  0)  unchecked primary key dashboard_id    numeric(18  0)  checked foreign key </code></pre>   the two tables have dashboard_id in common (the primary key of a dashboard table).    <strong>question:</strong>    how do i join these two tables based on their matching dashboard_id and insert this new table into my third table. and how do i put the two primary keys of the above tables into the new t hird table  which looks like this:   <pre><code>survey_link_widget:  survey_link_widget_id   numeric(18  0)  unchecked survey_id   numeric(18  0)  unchecked widget_id   numeric(18  0)  unchecked data_series_name    nvarchar(250)   unchecked data_series_displaytitle    nvarchar(250)   checked </code></pre>   survey_link_widget_id is auto incremented  which will create itself. survey_id and widget_id should be from the two tables that i intend to join based on dashboard_id    additionally  would it be hard to add the 4th and 5th column (data_series_name and data_series_displaytitle) to the insert/join query i m looking for     if you think i m handling this  link table  completely wrong  please tell me! my sql is really rusty at the moment  so i might just be doing silly things.,sql
counting frequently changing values on the database  i am building a social network site for educational purposes and was wondering how should i efficiently count  tweets  of a user (if for ex. on the tweets table he has 100k entries). should i do it via sql count() or should i add a  no. of tweets  field per user to fetch easily and update it when user add/delete a tweet  or if there are better approach on this  i d deeply appreciate your input.    how about the case of counting the total no. of characters of these  tweets   is sum(char_length(arg)) efficient  or caching an updated value better     let s say these values (no. of tweets and no. of characters for all tweets) are always being called because they are displayed publicly on their profiles  and <strong>on average</strong>  these numbers are getting called once per second and their values change once every 30 seconds.    i am just experimenting on algorithms involving large data  so a big thanks if you can help!    another thing  is php &amp; mariadb fit for this kind of process  or other stack are better,sql

how do you convert pseudo-code into sql statements   i am taking the free stanford database course online.  i don t have any db experience  but have many years of os programming experience.  typically  i will flowchart or write out pseudo-code for a particular algorithm before coding it up.  i was wondering if this technique can be used to go from a flowchart or pseudo-code into sql statements.    does a loop that iterates over a set match a where clause   is this mostly( ) or always( ) true     how would you map a doubly nested loop into sql,sql

sql - when i join an additional table  it adds rows to my results that i don t want to count  i m learning sql  for the second time  and i m not able to figure out how to join an additional table (that s required to access a field in that table that i want to sum)  without it returning additional rows to the results  as that is giving me incorrect counts.    that is my problem  as i see it  but maybe my approach is wrong.    what i need to accomplish is to total the itemprice s that are found in the orderitems table  per customer  for all their orders. i have done that  but not without getting the wrong counts for the number of orders  due to having to join that additional table.    here is the abbreviated code for the problem i m working on  followed by the results.  the results from running the code as-is on the left  and the results by un-commenting the 2 lines on the right.   <pre><code>select  customers.firstname  orders.customerid  count(*) as numoforders  from orders     join customers         on orders.customerid=customers.customerid --  join orderitems --      on orderitems.orderid=orders.orderid  group by customers.firstname  orders.customerid having count(*) &gt; 1 order by numoforders desc   fname     id    count                 fname      id    count ---------------------                 ---------------------- david      4    3                     allan       1    3 heather    8    2                     david       4    3 kris      18    2                     frank       6    3 bette     29    2                     heather     8    2 allan      1    2                     simona     14    2                                       kris       18    2                                       yuki       27    2                                       bette      29    2                                       chanel     35    2 </code></pre>,sql

sql query - select value from t1 where second value fully met in t2  i can do this in an ugly stored procedure with temp tables and whatnot  but i know an experienced developer could do this so much more elegantly than what i ve come up with. in fact  i d kind of rather not have to call the sproc at all  but just have one query that gives me what i need.    i m working with two tables:    <ul> <li>t1 billingdirectivesneeded </li> <li>t2 billingdirectives.</li> </ul>   t1 has two fields relevant to this task -    <ul> <li>pkey </li> <li>wbs1. </li> </ul>   there will be many pkeys associated with each wbs1.    t2 has only one field of interest   <ul> <li>pkey.</li> </ul>   the task i m trying to address is geting a list of wbs1s from t1 that have all of their needed directives in t2 before i enable their import.      we want to import a wbs1 only when all of the pkeys for that wbs1 are found in t2.  if not  i ll just leave them grayed out.    i ve tried a dozen different ways to get this to happen over the last few hours  and i seem to have a mental block.   the pseudo-code would look something like this:   <pre><code>select t1.wbs1 from billingdirectiveneeded t1  where [all the t1.pkeys for t1.wbs1 can be found in billingdirectives t2] </code></pre>,sql

partition sql result set into chunks  in preparation for a batch process  i need to partition groups of records in order to run parallel streams of a job.  these records come from a table that could potentially have millions of rows.  my goal is to evenly break up these records (by primary key) into (approximately) even chunks that can then be processed in parallel.  i want to choose the chunk size dynamically.  what may also be noteworthy is that there may be gaps in the primary key sequence.    in other words  given this table  with a predicate denoting the number of chunks and a result set providing the first and last sequence of the chunk:   <pre><code>  seq    name   | -------|--------| 1      | john   | 2      | joe    | 3      | joe    | 4      | joe    | 5      | joe    | 567    | kent   | 568    | katie  | 20000  | sue    | 200016 | jill   | 200027 | bill   | </code></pre>   i would get back the following results where (number-of-chunks) -> (first-seq  last-seq):   <pre><code>(2) -&gt; (1 5) (567 20027) (5) -&gt; (1 2) (3 4) (5 567) (568 20000) (200016 200027) </code></pre>   or  as a result set  something like this (when asking for 5 chunks):   <pre>  first_seq   last_seq  -----------|----------|   1        | 2        |   3        | 4        |   5        | 567      |   568      | 200000   |   20016    | 200027   |  </pre>   i m assuming some kind of window function is in order here  but i m not sure how to tackle this. can anyone assist me with the query,sql

redundant user generated data in a database - how to structure  e.g.  recipes share ingredients  i m building a website for which a large amount of user generated data will be stored in a back end db and will be discoverable by all users.    by its nature  a portion of the user entries will be redundant.  for the sake of example  let s imagine this data is made of recipes.  suppose the following entries:    <em>title: lemony dressing:<br> - 1 tbsp lemon juice<br> - 2 tbsp olive oil<br> just mix!</em>    and    <em>title: lemony marinade:<br> - 2 tbsp lemon juice<br> - 2 tbsp olive oil<br> - 1 tbsp soy sauce<br> just mix the ingredients together!</em>    clearly  those 2 entries have some redundant information: half the title is shared  the instructions are shared partially  one ingredient is shared exactly  another ingredient is partially shared....    furthermore  one could easily imagine a recipe made of several sub-recipes  which can also exist on their own.  so for example  you could have a <em>marinated flank steak</em> recipe that uses the <em>lemony marinade</em> as a step.  so recipes can be defined recursively.    my question is how should i structure my sql recipe database   my gut feeling is that it makes sense to store the entry  lemon juice  in an <em>ingredients</em> table  the quantity  2 tbsp  in a <em>quantity</em> one  and then use their keys in the <em>recipe</em> table.    but how far should i go   should i split  lemon juice  into two entries  in order to prevent duplication with  orange <strong>juice</strong>  and  <strong>lemon</strong> zest    after all  ingredients can also be defined recursively.    but then sentences can too  and instructions on how to use the ingredients are going to have some overlap - but over the long term maybe not all that much.  does it make sense then to store each word separately   why not letters     i m not sure how to consider the trade-offs like this.  i suppose that if i minimize the redundancy of the info in the tables  there must be some cost.  is it performance wise  or is it a cost paid at conception     thank you     jdelage,sql

how can i search the entire sql database for a specific column name  and then search only those columns for a specific value   at work  we use an absolutely massive database with multiple different programs writing to the main bucket. unfortunately  there s not always a good way to know from those individual programs where specific data points might be written to the database. i have a query that can search everything for a specific value or string  but because of the size of the database  it usually takes about 7 hours to complete.     i thought that if i could narrow the search a bit  i might be able to speed that up. a lot of the values i often have to look up would be under similarly named columns (i.e.  username    userid   etc.) is there a good way to do a search that looks through all of my tables for a specific column name  and then searches only those columns for the value that i m trying to locate     i found a similar question asked a few years back     <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17362695/search-sql-database-for-a-column-name-then-search-for-a-value-within-the-retune/17363526#17363526 newreg=60d4b0ef5e9745dab1333dcb6761f5a7 >search sql database for a column name  then search for a value within the retuned columns</a>    but when i run the answer  all it returns is  command(s) completed successfully.     i m still a little green at this  so i m not discounting the fact that it could be a picnic issue on my end.,sql

sql querying multiple schemas  i am looking to run a query on several schemas in workbench. bascially  they are all symmetric   just different dates. in workbench  i can only select one of them and run the query. is there a way to aggregate them and run the query over a selection of schemas     edit: to elaborate a bit more  i have schemas with names yyyy_mm_dd for each day. ideally  instead of doing a union over them as suggested by guish below  if would like a dynamic query that would be able to turn the name of the schema into a valid date and union all of them where the date is within a defined range. is this possible  i am using oracle and sql workbench,sql

many-to-many relationship between tables - how to model in sql  i m just wondering what the best implementation for a simple example like this is.    if i have 2 tables below and a unit has multiple upgrades which are variable amounts i was thinking of holding a list of ids of upgrades in an csv format then i d load the unit and extract the ids from the list of upgrade ids.    i just feel like there might be a better way to implement this because it s been quite a while since i ve worked in sql and i m not sure if this is best practice or any issue that i might not foresee.    tables    unit { id name upgrades }    upgrade { id name description },sql
count n-tuples in sql  i have a table with two int columns  the combination of them is unique.   <pre><code>ids  idk --------- 1    2 1    3 1    4  2    2 2    3 2    4  3    2 3    5 3    4  4    2 4    3 </code></pre>   what i want is to get the biggest set of idks which is common to at least 2 ids.    the result here should look like this:   <pre><code>(2 3 4) - 2x (2 4) - 3x (2 3) - 3x (3 4) - 2x (2 5) - 1x </code></pre>   as you see  the number of common idks is the most important thing. if the number is the same #(2 4) = #(2 5) then the criterion is the number of occurencies.    it seems to me rather like a algorithm which needs to be programmed but i may be wrong and sql is capable of it.,sql
sql splitting time when over midnight  i am after some guidance on the best way to get useful information out of our mis database    scenario:- i want to check staff utilisation by a variable period that i can drill down into. this needs to then be split into days so i can assess over a 24 hour period what was done    the table is huge and has loads of columns we need to calculate  so ideally i need to split the records that span 2 days into 2    the table has a datetimeformat field that has user [starttime]  it then has a separate field that has [duration] which is in decimal hours.    so an example would be:   <pre><code>id   starttime              duration      qty      username 1    2016-11-24 23:00:00       2.00       1000      joe bloggs </code></pre>   in the example above joe starts at 11pm and works till 1 am  so what i need is to somehow split this record in my query to put anything before midnight as 1 record and anything after into another this example is pretty simple as it is half/half but some might start at 10pm and finish at 6pm so i would need 2 hours and 6 hours.    not sure on the best way to do this  my initial thoughts was to create a cte where a start time is in 1 day and if the starttime + duration was in the next day then split the record.    not sure if there is an easier way or if anyone has had to do this before.    any help appreciated,sql

sql update based on parts of another field  i need to update a field based on partial matches of another.   field2  is a constant 4 characters in length.  what i was trying to do was have it look at field2 and if it started with an f then update field1 to 340.  then if it starts with an f and the 3rd character is a 3 then update field1 to 344 and so on.    basically  340 would be the rule when field2 starts with f and f*3* would be the exception and needs to be called 344.    the problem of course is that using  like f*3*  is not actually looking for a 3 in the third position but rather anywhere after the f.    is there a way to do this   i appreciate any help.    jim   <pre><code>docmd.runsql  update [table] set [table].[field1] =   340   where (([table]![field2] like   f*  ));   -1 docmd.runsql  update [table] set [table].[field1] =   344   where (([table]![field2] like   f*3*  ));   -1 docmd.runsql  update [table] set [table].[field1] =   343   where (([table]![field2] like   f*4*  ));   -1 </code></pre>,sql

double inner join with grouping  here s one for the sql junkies:    i have two tables: student names and student registrations. a student will register 1 or 2 times in a year  and over the course of a degree 8 to 10 times. i want to pull up all the students currently in the system (i.e. all students in 2013)  which i do with the following:   <pre><code>select studentkey  lastname  firstname  count(year) as registrations     from  uctprogrammesregistered      left join uctstudents     on uctstudents.studentnumber=uctprogrammesregistered.studentkey     where programmeregistered=  .$programmecode.   and year=  .$year.        group by studentkey  lastname  firstname     order by studentkey  lastname </code></pre>   this gives me the result with the number of times registered in the current year. however  what i really want is the number of times ever registered by the students over all previous years registered. note this can t be solved by just relaxing the year=$year part of the where since that will give me all students ever registered in the institution. i just want from the students presently registered to know how many times this group of students registered.    i thought using the join statement multiple times should help (i.e. include another join on the same table uctprogrammesregistered  but somehow with only where programmeregistered=  .$programmecode.   and leaving off the year check - that would work  but sql doesn t seem to cooperate with this idea.,sql
choosing primary key  i want to create an  users  table which include a  email address  and/or  username  <code>unique</code> field  should i also add an  id  <code>int usigned auto_increment</code> to be the <code>primary key</code> or not     i m asking because i ve seen some textbook examples using an  id  field in such a table with another <code>unique</code> field.,sql
sql query: get all <parenttablerecord>s not matched to a <child> with attribute value = <value>  suppose i have a table  [owner]  with only a  name . then i have a table [dog]  with a  name   a  leashcolor   and an  ownername .    sample data:   <pre><code>owner: &lt;name: joe&gt;  &lt;name: sue&gt; dog: &lt;name: rover  leashcolor: red  ownername: joe&gt;       &lt;name: pup  leashcolor: green  ownername: joe&gt;       &lt;name: spot  leashcolor: purple  ownername: sue&gt;       &lt;name: lassie  leashcolor: yellow  ownername: sue&gt; </code></pre>   i would like a sql query that gets all owners without a dog named .  for example  the query  when the input  =  rover   would return sue because she does not have a dog named rover  but joe does.    if possible  it would be even better to have a query that gets all owners without a dog named   but if they do have a dog named   get them if the dogs leash color is     so  with input   =  rover  and  =  red   both joe and sue would be returned (sue not having a rover  joe having a rover with a red leash).  but  if the input is  rover    green   only sue would be returned (sue not having a rover  joe having a rover and color not being green).    i ve been puzzling over this one for a while.  i would be very grateful for any tips.,sql

how do i set order by in sql query to a value depending by the sql query itself   imagine an auction (ebay auction  for example). you create an auction  set the start bidding value  let s say  5 dollars. this gets stored as a minimal bid value to the <code>auctions</code> table.at this point  the <strong>current</strong> bid value of this auction is <strong>5 dollars</strong>.    now  if someone bids to your auction  let s say  10 dollars  this gets stored to the <code>bids</code> table.at this point  the <strong>current</strong> bid value of this auction is <strong>10 dollars</strong>.    now let s imagine you want to retrieve 5 cheapest auctions. you will write a query like this:   <pre><code>select `auction_id`  `auction_startprice`  max(bids.bid_price) as `bid_price` from `auctions` left join `bids` on `auctions`.`auction_id`=`bids`.`bid_belongs_to_auction` group by `auction_id` limit 5 </code></pre>   pretty simple  and it works! but now you need to add an <code>order by</code> clause to the query. the problem is  however  that we want to <code>order by</code> <strong>either</strong> by <code>auctions.auction_startprice</code> <strong>or</strong> by <code>bid_price</code>  depending on <strong>whichever of this is higher</strong>  as explained in the first paragraphs.    can this be understood  i know how to do this using 2 queries  but i am hoping it can be done with 1 query.    thanks!    edit: just a further explanation to help you imagine the problem. if i set <code>order by auction_startprice asc</code>  then i will get 5 auctions with their lowest initial bid price  but what if there are already bids placed on those auctions  then their current lowest price is equal to those bids  not to the start price  therefore my query is wrong.,sql

pull column fields into another table as new rows  i m stumbling on this one  hopefully its easy and i m looking at it wrong.    i m receiving formatted xls files.  have a c# app that processes the data and does an sqlbulkcopy insert to my table.  there are 5 pairs of columns  one is a url text description and one a url itself.  these urls will reference an html or pdf file i will pull later into a second separate table.    leaving out unrelated fields  i have a table <strong>[base]</strong> with fields:<br>   <blockquote>    [id] (identity)<br> [baseid]<br> ...a bunch of other related fields    then...<br> [linktext1]<br> [linkurl1]<br> [linktext2]<br>   [linkurl2]<br> [linktext3]<br> [linkurl3]<br> [linktext4]<br>   [linkurl4]<br> [linktext5]<br> [linkurl5]  </blockquote>   the storage for the urls/files will be in a table <strong>[documents]</strong> with fields:<br>   <blockquote>    [baseidentityid] - references the id field from [base] table<br>   [docindex] - each base record can have 1 - 5 of the urls filled in.    this is to know which url # it is.<br> [mimetype]<br> [url]<br>   [text]<br> [content]<br> [processed] - bit - will pull the url data at   a later time  this flags that.  </blockquote>   i m using an instead of trigger on my [base] table.  these records can be updated so we re keeping archived data in the table.  the trigger looks at what we re inserting  flags the existing versions as old  and inserts this new base record as the currentversion.    in this trigger  i d now like to insert into the [documents] table a new row based on each of the 5 pairs of url data  passing in the [base] id identity field for the [baseidentityid] in the documents table  and a 1 for [docindex] for linkurl1  2 for [docindex] for linkurl2  etc...    having a hard time visualizing how i will do that exactly.  any suggestions   i m trying to avoid using cursors as i could have a pretty large collection of base records to insert.    thanks.,sql

last record of a join table (how to optimize)  i have the same  problem  as described in (<a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1078280/last-record-of-join-table >last record of join table</a>): i need to join a  master table  with a  history table  whereas i only want to join the latest (by date) record of the the history table. so whenever i query a record for the mastertable i also geht the  latest  data of the history table.   <pre><code>master table   id   firstname   lastname   ...  history table   id   lastaction   date </code></pre>   this is possible by joining both tables and using a subselect to retrieve the latest history table record as described in the answer given in the link above.     my quesions are: how can i solve the problem  that there might be in theory two history records with the same date      is this kind of joining with the subselect really the best solution in terms of performance (and in general)  what do you think (i am no expert in all this stuff) if i integrate a further attribute in the history table that is named  islatestrecord  as a boolean flag that i manage manually (and that has a unique constrained). this attribute will then explicitly mark the latest record and i do not need any subselects as i can directly use this attribute in the where clause of the join. on the other hand  this makes inserting a new record of course a little bit more complicated: i first have to remove the  islatestrecord  flag from the latest record  i have to insert the new history record with the  islatestrecord  set and commit the transaction.     what do you think is the recommended solution  i do not have any clue about the performance impact of the subselects: i might have millions of  mastertable  records  that i have to search for a specific record also using in the search attributes of the joined history table like:  give me the mastertable record with firstname xyz and the lastaction (of the history table) was  changed_name . so this subselect might be called millions of times.     or is it better work with a subselect to find the latest record  as subselects are very efficient and its better to keep everything normalized     thank you very much,sql

creating an evaluation query for 3 months  6 months and 12 months  i am in need of getting correct query for gathering records based on their hire_date and their evaluations that occurs with these parameters:   <ul> <li>3 months</li> <li>6 months</li> <li>12 months</li> </ul>   from system_date.    the way the report will work is collecting employees that have evaluations due dates between 30 days past and 90 days after the current system_date.    here is the tricky part: if the hire_date is greater than 1 year from system_date than only 12 month evaluations will exist.  if their current assignment changes  as in their job  they revert back to 3  6 and 12 months evaluations  but will ultimately end up being back in 12 months evaluations.      let me know if you need more clarification.     <strong>flow chart</strong>:    <img src= https://i.stack.imgur.com/1f4o4.jpg  alt= flow-chart >,sql

sql  quering data from one table with criteria from another  i don t have much experience with sql and i m pretty much lost when it comes to anything more advanced than simple insert/select statements.    my scenario is this  i have the following two tables:    games { int id  int finished }    submissions { int game_id int user_id }    and i want to query any id from games where finished=0 and a specific user_id is not tied together with the id in mind in the submissions table.    so in other words  i want to find a game that isn t finished and a specific user haven t played.    i know i can do this with multiple queries and logic (in java and jdbc if it matters)  but i rather learn how to do it with pure sql!     thanks!,sql
sql joining two tables and relabeling column  i am using an sql database  which is a dbms. its the lyric database.

how do i write this tricky sql query   <strong>[fyi  this is not homework &mdash; i guess everyone thinks that because i made an effort to format my question in a simple readable form   again  not homework.  i m at work  and just trying to learn.  thanks.]</strong>    i m very stuck on a tricky one.  i m a java guy  i m not a sql guy  so any help with this is greatly appreciated!    i have a project table and a task table like so:   <pre><code>**project** projectid name </code></pre>   project has many tasks:   <pre><code>**task** taskid projectid description userid // the user who is assigned the task status // either  in_progress  or  complete  sequence // the numeric sequence of the task in the project </code></pre>   for example:   <pre><code>project    projectid=100    name= build house  task    taskid=250 // task ids are not necessary in numerical order    sequence=1    description= pour foundation     userid=55    status= complete  task    taskid=240    sequence=2    description= build walls     userid=56    status= complete  task    taskid=260    sequence=3    description= install windows     userid=57    status= in_progress  task    taskid=245    sequence=4    description= build roof     userid=58    status= in_progress  </code></pre>   i need two queries:    (1) for a given projectid  get the  current task .  the current task is the task number with the smallest <code>sequence</code> number which is not complete.  in my example  <code>getcurrenttask(projectid=100)</code> would return taskid 260 (because it s the first one that is incomplete).    (2) for a given userid  get the list of projects where he is assigned to a  current task .  in my example  <code>getprojectsforuserid(userid=57)</code> would return projectid 100; <code>getprojectsforuserid(userid=58)</code> would return nothing.,sql
database table schema design - varchar(n). suitable choice of n  coming from a c background  i may be getting too anal about this and worrying unnecessarily about bits and bytes here.     still  i cant help thinking how the data is actually stored and that if i choose an n which is easily factorizable into a power of 2  the database will be more efficient in how it packs data etc.    using this  logic   i have a string field in a table which is a variable length up to 21 chars. i am tempted to use 32 instead of 21  for the reason given above - however now i am thinking that i am wasting disk space because there will be space allocated for 11 extra chars that are guaranteed to be never used. since i envisage storing several tens of thousands of rows a day  it all adds up.    question:    mindful of all of the above  should i declare varchar(21) or varchar(32) and why     <strong>[edit]</strong>    the data being stored conforms to an external specification  and can never be more than 21 chars long. i am using both mysql and postgresql  but ideally  i want the answer to be database agnostic  since i try to not get tied down by any particular vendor.,sql

is it possible to have a space in the title of a column in a temporary table   i am trying to create the names of columns in a temporary table with spaces. the reason i need these spaces in the name is so that it connects properly with our asp.net application that will be using this as a data set. because the columns from other regular tables have a space  the code is looking for an item in the data set with a space as well. below is an example of what i m trying to do   <pre><code>declare @temp table (id int  scheduled start datetime) </code></pre>   but this is not allowed  and will throw an error. in the server side of my application (asp.net - vb) - the call to use this field looks like this   <pre><code>lblstart.text = ds.item( scheduled start ) </code></pre>   this is why i need the space in the name  in the temporary table  so that when using the regular results or results from the temporary table  the dataset will work for the same server side code. is this possible  i have tried to use quotes  but not having any luck. thanks again.,sql

returning a result from a query  then a record count of that specific result  the title is slightly confusing  but basically  i have created a search feature which allows my users to enter search terms.  say if they entered  e  it would return answers such as  leeds  manchester  liverpool  doncaster  etc. basically  i want something that then checks each of those towns/cities one by one  checks how many bands are registered from those towns/cities  and display say:    **  leeds - 5 records found **    it would be easy if you could output multiple queries at once  however  you can t. if somebody knows a way around this i would be very grateful.,sql

how do i join 2 tables and search for 2 conditions including a sum  i have two tables  and two conditions that i am trying to write a query for.    i need to join the two following tables:   <ol> <li>trans</li> <li>transunit</li> </ol>   they are joined by the <em>accountid</em> field which is in both tables  i also want the <em>clientid</em> which is in the trans table.    secondly i also need for the field <em>allocated</em> in trans table to be  %y   and i need the sum of the <em>units</em> field for each accountid in transunit to be greater than 0.     i can join the two tables  but i m struggling with using the two conditions to filter the data.    the only columns i would like to return from the 2 tables is:   <ol> <li>accountid</li> <li>clientid</li> <li>sum(units)</li> </ol>   here s what i have so far...   <pre><code>select  trans.accountid trans.clientid from   inner join transunit  on trans.accountid = transunit.accountid where trans.isallocated like  %y%   </code></pre>   this joins the two tables  and uses 1 condition.    i have the 2nd query which sums all records in transunits table by accountid. 1 account id can have multiple units records. i am just looking for accountid which have sum greater than 0.    <pre><code>select count(*)  sum(units) as sumunits accountid from transunit group by accountid  </code></pre>   now the tricky part  how do i join these two queries together  and filter so that i only display when sum is greater than 0.    any help would be much appreciated  thanks.,sql

return data without including that data in the comparison  i am using the below code:   <pre><code>select l_name  f_name  user_id from (select a.l_name  a.f_name  count(*)       from shema.emp_table1 a  schema2.emp_table2 b      where     a.emp_id = b.emp_id2            and b.office_num =  4017             and a.email is null     having count (a.l_name) &gt; 1     group by a.l_name  a.f_name     order by a.l_name  a.f_name) group by l_name  f_name; </code></pre>   ...what i want to do is return the users last name  first name and user id  if the users in the database  match up  on last name (potential duplicates).  where i m running into problems is that the user_id field is going to be unique for each user...so even though they may share a last and first name  the user id is unique...and this is causing my query to return zero rows.  if i eliminate the user id field from the search criteria  i get the list i m looking for:  users who share a last and first name...(for instance doe  john with a count of 4).  but even though i don t want the query against the user id  i do want it as one of the  returned fields ...but i can t seem to get it to do that.    any assistance would be most appreciated.  i ve tried many different variations of the above query  with/without counts inside and out  with/without user_id inside and out  etc.  and so far no luck in getting what i m looking for.    what i d like to have as output would be something like:   <pre><code>l_name                 f_name                  user_id               count(*) smith                  john                    abc123                2 smith                  john                    bcd234                2 </code></pre>   ...although  now that i m looking for it  the query may not work because the  count(*)  won t be 2 for smith  john with a user id of abc123...the  user id  is causing it to be more difficult than i d like.  do i need to write an anomyous block to fill this kind of request     thanks!,sql

sql assistance needed for a not so simple query  i have a database with a customer table and a loan table.  the customer table has about 11 000 records.  the loan table has the customer account numbers for each loan entry and specific codes for what type of loan product was taken.  however  as you can see  not every customer has taken a loan out  so that table has fewer records than the customer table.  i need to find a way to gather the customers that meet certain criteria from customers (are they active for example)  then possibly join (<em>maybe</em>) to the loan table and return the codes for a specific loan.  however  i d still want the customers from the customers table who didn t take loans included in the record set.    so  all the customers who are active and if there is data for that customer in the loan table to return that in the recordset.    i m just unsure how to get it done  any assistance would be appreciated.,sql

calculated fields in sql select statment  i m trying to understand better how select statement calculated fields work. what i m attempting to do is calculate video completion rate or vcr  this is calculated by completes/impressions. so i wrote the following code:   <pre><code>select completes  impressions  completes/impression as vcr from video_table where (completes &gt; 0) </code></pre>   the issue i run into is that for some reason there are videos that for whatever reason have 0 completes and lets say 25 000 impressions. on an individual level my calculation works fine but when you begin wrapping all these video up into say a website the vcr drops alot because of these 0 complete placement level video but they still have impressions. i m wondering how do i deal with those 0 complete video placements even when i calculate the vcr for an entire website that consists of say 50 video placements of which 10 have 0 completes and 25 000 impressions     thanks anyone for ideas    <em><strong>edit</em></strong>    simple example is:   <pre><code>completes 1. 0 2. 7  impressions 1. 10 2. 10  total vcr should equal 7/10 = 70%  **not**  7/20 = 35% </code></pre>,sql

sql query - mod function - how can i use it to group results   i m very new to querying so apologies if this is a simple question. note this question is related to microsoft query as i am pulling the results through to a report.    i currently have a table with a number of columns  including one column that is an integer value between 1 and 6. i am trying to group by on this column based on whether the value in the column is even or odd but am just not sure how to accomplish this given my knowledge (a bit of background as to why i want this: the table i am using relates to timesheet entries with the shift column i am referring to having odd values for day shift and even values for night shift). if someone could help this would be great. currently  i have the following code:   <pre><code>select     prth.postdate  hrrm.lastname  hrrm.firstname      sum(prth.hours) as  sum of hours       (prth.shift mod 2) as  night shift  from     viewpoint.dbo.hrrm hrrm  viewpoint.dbo.prth prth where     prth.employee = hrrm.premp and prth.jcco = hrrm.prco group by     prth.postdate  hrrm.lastname  hrrm.firstname  night shift </code></pre>   it is the <code>mod</code> function that i am having trouble with as i am not sure how to define this and then also how to use this in the group by function.    thanks in advance,sql
easiest way to copy data from one table to another table   after grabbing result  what is the easiest way to grab certain fields from #result and put them into a different table (the data types might not match  which will require some conversions).     <pre><code>select * into #result from table1 </code></pre>   can i do a  select * into  or maybe a cursor to loop through #result and insert it into the destination table   is there an even better way,sql
database design  for optimized access  i jump straight into the problem  currently i have a table as such   <pre><code>id | model | categoryid | etc... </code></pre>   now my new requirement is to have support for multiple categories. so i have two possible solutions in mind but i would like to know problems that both this designs might create. i also know that at most i can have 6 categories  also i can t create a linker table to link product to category.    on first design i would simply create column  categoryn     <pre><code>id | model | categoryid1 | categoryid2 | categoryid3 | categoryid4 | etc... </code></pre>   but this would make queries hideous    <pre><code>   id | model | categoryid | etc... </code></pre>   my second approach is simply to add product for n categories   <pre><code>   id | model | categoryid | etc...    1 | abc   | 1           | etc...    2 | abc   | 2           | etc...    3 | abc   | 3           | etc... </code></pre>   i think queries would be cleaner but not necessarily simpler. another aspect is that i am looking at the performance of the queries and it looks like the first approach would be better. i hope this is clear enough.    thanks for any suggestions.,sql

how to query the maximum value of two columns in two different tables   i have a requirement.    i have two tables say tablea and tableb. both having a column called  rec_id . my requirement is to get the maximum of the values contained in these two columns using a single query.    eg: in tablea  i have  rec_id  values as {1 5 6} and in tableb  i have  rec_id  values as {1 4 2}. so after executing the query  i want  6  as the result since 6 is the maximum value from these two columns  out of these two tables.    thanks in advance  anish kurian,sql

how to unpivot a table without a unpivot operator   given this example: <a href= https://i.stack.imgur.com/xlr6l.png  rel= nofollow noreferrer >pivoted table</a>    and the desired output is the following: <a href= https://i.stack.imgur.com/9tjcc.png  rel= nofollow noreferrer >desired result</a>    so my question is. i m running a proprietary server which i cannot mention here and this server does not support unpivot operator. i have tried so far the following:   <pre><code>select week         day         username         case            when main_cat_1 =  cars  then  cars             when main_cat_2 =  vans  then  vans         else null end as main_cat         case            when sub_cat_1.1 =  dirty  then  dirty             when sub_cat_1.2 =  stalled  then  stalled         else null end as sub_cat        from table1 </code></pre>   the issue with this approach is that because of <strong>short-circuit evaluation</strong> after the first true valueit does not seem to work properly and does not return the expected values.,sql

combine multiple inner joined rows into one row with multiple columns  i have a questions table and an answers table that has 4 to 8 answers connected to one question. when i want to get a list of questions and their answers  i use the following code:   <pre><code>select q.questionid  q.question  a.answer from question as q inner join answer as a on q.questionid=a.questionid; </code></pre>   this gives me one row for each answer with the question being repeated on each row. however  i want to only get one row per question with the answers in separate columns. if possible  i d like to also limit this to only 4 answers. if there are more than 4  the rest should just be ignored. this is however not as important.    the four answer columns would be named  correct    wrong1    wrong2  and  wrong3 . the first one in the table (with the lowest answerid) is the correct one.    thank you for your help!,sql
where clause based on conditions  i have a query where i match a column. the value to be matched may be null or not null (some value exists). the problem arises when the matching takes place. in case value is present the matching like   <pre><code>table.column = somevalue </code></pre>   works fine  but in case the value is null  then the matching needs to be done as    <pre><code>table.column is null </code></pre>   is there some way that i can choose the condition being used in the where clause based on the value     thanks in advance,sql

sql vs code  where is the balance   as a crud developer one of the trade offs that needs to be made is the decision of how much of the work should be done in sql on the server  and how much ought to be done on the client end in code.    <strong>how do you decide where the fulcrum goes    what factors go into your decisions   what kind of mistakes have you made  what works well </strong>    [edit]  i am kind of surprised in the low volume of responses to this question.  i think this is a basic issue for all crud programming.  where the balance is set is a trade off between performance and maintainability.    the other issue i didn t really consider is the fact that the domains vary enough  that the answers probably need to be expressed in sections for each domain.  that s kind of what i tried to do in my answer.,sql
sql selecting records where one date range doesn t intersect another  i m trying to write a simple reservation program for a campground.    i have a table for campsites (one record for every site available at the campground).<br> i have a table for visitors which uses the campsite table s id as a foreign key  along with a check in date and check out date.    what i need to do is gather a potential check in and check out date from the user and then gather all the campsites that are not being used at any point in that range of dates.    i think i m close to the solution but there s one piece i seem to be missing.    i m using 2 queries.  1) gather all the campsites that are occupied during that date range. 2) gather all campsites that are not in query 1.    this is my first query:   <pre><code>select visitors.campsiteid  visitors.checkindate  visitors.checkoutdate from visitors where (((visitors.checkindate)&gt;=#checkindate#      and (visitors.checkindate)&lt;=#checkoutdate#)      or ((visitors.checkoutdate)&gt;=#checkindate#      and (visitors.checkoutdate)&lt;=checkoutdate)); </code></pre>   i think i m missing something.  if the #checkindate# and #checkoutdate# both occur between someone else s check-in and check-out dates  then this doesn t catch it.    i know i could split this between two queries  where one is dealing with just the #checkindate# and the second is dealing with the #checkoutdate#  but i figure there s a cleaner way to do this and i m just not coming up with it.    this is my second one  which i think is fine the way it is:   <pre><code>select distinct campsites.id  qrycamps_notavailable.campsiteid from campsites left join qrycamps_notavailable  on campsites.id = qrycamps_notavailable.campsiteid where (((qrycamps_notavailable.campsiteid) is null)); </code></pre>   thanks  charles,sql

what is the proper way to deal with non-unique rows that will become unique  i m building a database for archery tournament shoots. one of the tables holds the work shifts for the volunteers working it.    it currently looks like this:   <pre><code>+-------+---------+--------+---------+-------+-----+ | jobid | shiftid | userid | eventid | hours | day | +-------+---------+--------+---------+-------+-----+ |    10 |       9 |   1125 |       6 | null  |   1 | |    11 |       9 |      0 |       6 | null  |   1 | +-------+---------+--------+---------+-------+-----+ </code></pre>   jobid links to the jobs i.e. registration  kitchen.    shiftid links to the hours of the shift i.e. 7-9 (hours is there at the request of the event owner as a shift may run long).    userid links to the volunteer...    eventid links to the specific event.    day is day of the event  for events that span multiple days.    the entries are populated for the events  and then users are added. this currently allows for a unique constraint to be placed on the concatenated columns (jobid  shiftid  userid  eventid).    however  the event owner now wants to be able to have multiple shifts in an event at the same time. the entries will be unique after the user has been registered.    what would be the proper way to deal with this  these were the solutions that i thought of  but none of them felt right:   <ol> <li>making a new shift.</li> <li>making a new job.</li> <li>making a new table for pending jobshifts.</li> <li>removing the unique constraint on the table.</li> <li>adding another column to deal with the duplicate shifts.</li> </ol>,sql

sql conditional select - calculate running total  i have a stored procedure that calculates requirements for customers based on input that we receive from them.    displaying this information is not a problem.    what i d like to do is show the most recent received amount and subtract that from the weekly requirements.    so if last friday i shipped 150 items and this weeks requirements are 100 items for each day then i d like the data grid to show 0 for monday  50 for tuesday  100 for wednesday - friday.    i have currently tried using with limited success the sample select statement -    <pre><code>select customer  partnumber  lastreceivedqty  day1qty  day2qty  day3qty  day4qty  day5qty  totalrequired from requirements </code></pre>   obviously the above select statement does nothing but display data as it is in the table.  so when i add the case state as follows i get a bit closer to what i need but not fully and i m unsure how to proceed.   <pre><code>select customer  partnumber  lastreceivedqty    day1qty  = case when day1qty &gt; 0 then day1qty - lastreceivedqty end ... </code></pre>   this method works ok as long as the lastreceivedqty is less than the day1 requirements but it s incorrect because it allows a negative number to be displayed in day one rather than pulling the remainder from day2.    sample data looks like the following:   <pre><code>customer    partnumber  lastreceivedqty day1qty day2qty day3qty day4qty day5qty totalrqd  45bi          2526            150          -50     100     100     100       </code></pre>   in the sample above the requirements for part number 2526 day 1 are 100 and the last received qty is 150 the day1qty shows -50 as opposed to zeroing out day 1 and subtract from day2  3  etc.    how do i display those figures without showing a negative balance on the requirement dates     any help/suggestions on this is greatly appreciated.,sql

max grade value for repeated course by student  i am working on a student enrollment database project.  students enroll in courses and receive grades.  sometimes a student repeats a course and gets a better grade.  i need to calculate the gpa by using only the best grade.  so for each student that repeats courses  i have to determine what the highest grade is.  recordnum represents the student  enrolltype =  rt  identifies a retake  gradevalue is the numeric value of the letter grade  and coursenum represents the course id.      i have tried this;   <pre><code>select recordnum  coursenum  gradevalue ; from enrollment ; where gradevalue in (select max(gradevalue) from enrollment) </code></pre>   but this gives me the max grade regardless of what student took the course.    i also tried a subselect:   <pre><code>select recordnum  coursenum  gradevalue ; from enrollment ; where coursenum in (select coursenum  enrolltype where enrolltype = rt ) </code></pre>   lastly  i tried this;   <pre><code>select recordnum  coursenum  gradevalue = max(gradevalue) ; from enrollment ; group by recordnum  coursenum </code></pre>   but i didn t get any grouping and all records had a value of true regardless of max value.  this could be a vfoxpro thing or possibly the gradevalue = max(gradevalue) is evaluated prior to grouping (not sure).    i am using visual foxpro 9.0 but should be able to translate to other sql variants  mostly i need to understand conceptually how to do this.    here is an example of what i am trying to accomplish.    starting data:   <pre> recordnum   |coursenum  |enroltyp   |gradevalue ---------------------------------------------------------- 100         |eng101a    |           |3 100         |eng101a    |rt         |2 100         |mth101     |           |3.2 </pre>   expected result:   <pre> recordnum   |coursenum  |enroltyp   |gradevalue ---------------------------------------------------------- 100         |eng101a    |           |3 100         |mth101     |           |3.2 </pre>   in this example the student takes eng101a and gets a b (3 grdpoints).  the student wants an even better grade  retakes the course but gets a lower grade (2 grdpoints).  since our policy is that the better grade is used  i have to first identify any courses that are retakes and get its coursenum  in this case eng101a.  then list all eng101a courses for recordnum 100 and take the max value of the gradevalue.,sql

logic to split revenue data by account if there are multiple data points  first off sql noob here so my question may not make sense.    table 1 has the id and name (the table i want to add data too) table 2 is a big table with millions of data points that i need to pull revenue information from.    table 2 also has dateid which i converted to month and year somehow i want to aggregate the month and year into a quarter year and this is how far i got. i really need to keep this script like below but just modified slightly.     so in the end i want to have revenue by product and by quarter. what am i missing      here is my script   <pre><code>select t1.nameid      t1.date_id        -- month       period_idtoid(t1.date_id dateid monthofyear) as month        -- year   period_idtoid(t1.date_id dateid yearid) as year  select t1.month t1.year    case      when month in (1 2 3) and year = 2012 then  q1 2012      when month in (4 5 6) and year = 2012 then  q2 2012      when month in (7 8 9) and year = 2012 then  q3 2012      when month in (10 11 12) and year = 2012 then  q4 2012      when month in (1 2 3) and year = 2013 then  q1 2013      when month in (4 5 6) and year = 2013 then  q2 2013      when month in (7 8 9) and year = 2013 then  q3 2013      when month in (10 11 12) and year = 2013 then  q4 2013      when month in (1 2 3) and year = 2013 then  q1 2014      when month in (4 5 6) and year = 2013 then  q2 2014      end as  quarter       from  big table t1           sum(case when product_group =  dog food  then revenue else 0 end) as dog_food_spend         sum(case when product_group =  cat food  then revenue else 0 end) as cat_food_spend         sum(case when product_group =  parrot food  then revenue else 0 end) as parrot_food_spend      from table 2 t1 join      table 1 t2      on t1.nameid = t2.nameid group by 1 2 3 4 5 </code></pre>,sql
sql query logic multiple records  i need to create a query to return rows where a customer_id has multiple prospect_ids associated with it. for example  i would like the query to be ale to return rows 2 and 3 below  since the customer_id is the same  but the prospect_ids are different  but not rows 5 and 6  since the prospect_ids are the same:   <pre><code>prospect_id   customer_id 1001          31001 1002          31002 1003          31002 1004          31003 1005          31004 1005          31004  </code></pre>,sql
hello  i am having difficulty writing this query:  (database code is located beneath the questions)    write a query to list all jobs that have work entered for them. include the job id  job description  and job status description. list the total hours worked for each job with the lowest  highest  and average hourly rate. the average hourly rate should be weighted based on the number of hours worked at that rate. make sure that your data includes at least one job that does not have hours logged. this job should not be included in the query. order by highest to lowest average hourly rate.   <pre><code>create table tcustomers (     intcustomerid                               integer         not null      strfirstname                               varchar(30)     not null

force distinct records from multiple field criteria inner joins  i m trying to return a distinct list of patients given certain criteria.  i m using an inner join to look at all patient records that meet a certain criteria and then look at the max service date  and further the max charge amount for that day  to force a unique record.  below is an abbreviated example showing that a patient may have had 4 charges on the same service date.    <a href= https://i.stack.imgur.com/e6bgt.jpg  rel= nofollow noreferrer ><img src= https://i.stack.imgur.com/e6bgt.jpg  alt= enter image description here ></a>    i want to pull the max charge on that day to get a distinct record match.  however  my current code is concatenating the max service date with a max charge from any found service date  creating a hypothetical record such as the following from the above example:   <pre><code>10/3/2016   9/30/2016   sebert  stephen l md  76598   chg   238 </code></pre>   this record does not exist in the database so i m losing the count and not returning a match to get the patient demographic information.  i hope this makes sense.  here s my code.  i m using an inner joing to do it.  please let me

sql translating two rows from one table with another  i am quite new to sql and am having problems with the following. my actual problem is quite complex but the below example crystalises the problem i have.    imagine two tables as follows:-    table 1   <pre><code>|name | id1 | id2 | -------------------- | xxx | 1  |  1   | -------------------- | yyy | 3  |  1   | -------------------- | zzz | 2  |  1   | </code></pre>   table 2   <pre><code>| id | desc | -------------- | 1  | aaa  | ------------- | 2  | bbbb | -------------- | 3  | ccc  | </code></pre>   the meaning of both numbers in id1 and id2 in table 1 are given by the description in table 2.    as i understand the following query would allow me to use the description rather than the id for id1 in table1 in the where clause:   <pre><code>select name from table1 inner join      table2      on table.id1 = table2.id where table2.desc =  aaa ; </code></pre>   but what i can t work out is a way of specifying it so that i can access both id1 and id2 simultaneously in the where clause by the description defined in table2.    i can t help feeling that this must be a pretty standard proceedure but can t work it out.    any suggestions are most welcome    silas,sql

which is reasonable to use for a field that appears in three tables: an enum or a table   i have a field that should contain the place of a seminar. a seminar can be held:   <ul> <li>in-house</li> <li>in another city</li> <li>in another country</li> </ul>   at first  i had only one table  so i have used an enum. but now i have three tables which can t be merged and they all should have this information and customer wants this field to be customizable to add or remove options in the future. but the number of options will be limited they say  probably 5 or so.    now  my question is  should i use an enum or a table for this field  more importantly  what would be the proper way to decide between an enum or a table     ps: enum fields are dynamically retrieved from the database  they are not embedded in the code.,sql

sql projection cost  i have two tables a and b. these tables are linked via a.bid = b.id. table a has 19 columns and table b has 10 columns. both tables contain approximately 40 000 records.     i have been looking at the following 3 simple queries:   <pre><code>-- query 1 select col1  col2  col3  col4  col5 from a  b where a.bid = b.id  -- query 2 select * from a  -- query 3 select col1 from a </code></pre>   what i have found interesting is that query 2 takes by far the longest to run  followed by query 1 (the join) and the fastest being query 3 (a more restrictive projection). all 3 queries return the same number of rows.    what is causing this behaviour  why is the number of columns in the projection having such a large impact on performance  of course i understand that the projection isn t free but i don t understand how a join (albeit with a more restricted projection) can run faster (a lot faster) than a simple <code>select *</code> operation.    thanks.,sql

sql troubling exam query  so i have a databases exam in the coming weeks  and as usual i decided to go over the past papers to see how the question might be. everything went along fine until i came across this question.   <blockquote>    write a sql construct for the following query: which forests are found   in the same geographical region (fo_loc) and are owned by the same   company. the output should have the following structure: larger forest   name  smaller forest name  and company name. try to avoid printing the   same forest names pairs more than once.  </blockquote>   this is the schema relevant to the question:    table: <strong>forest</strong>    <pre><code>fo_name character(10) p.k. fo_size integer fo_loc character(10) fo_comp character(10)) </code></pre>   with my limited knowledge of sql i do not think this question can be solved declaratively  so i tried also pl/sql (or rather plpgsql) and i was getting closer and closer to the solution  but it soon dawned on me that i was using many commands we did not cover in class not to mention the solution was getting far from what one would expect out of a 3 mark question.    and so i decided to write here... what is it that i m missing  any help would be greatly appreciated.    thanks,sql

sql query - errors on column name but is not like that  i am very new to this. i have created this table and i had no problems doing it:   <pre><code>create table [dbo].[urban_rail] ( [id]      int           identity (1  1) not null  [country] varchar (50)  not null  [city]    varchar (50)  not null  [type]    varchar (50) not null  [gauge]   nchar (10)    null  [year]    nchar (10)    null  [status]  varchar (50)  null  [notes]   varchar (500) null  primary key clustered ([id] asc) ); </code></pre>   now i am trying to fill in few thousand rows of data using this statement:   <pre><code>insert into urban_rail ( id   country   city   type   gauge   year   status   notes ) values (    algeria   algiers   metro   1435   2011   open    ); insert into urban_rail ( id   country   city   type   gauge   year   status   notes ) values (    algeria   algiers   tram   1435   2011   open    ); insert into urban_rail ( id   country   city   type   gauge   year   status   notes ) values (    algeria   batna   tram         planned    ); </code></pre>   but i get errors saying that the name of each column is not valid. that does not look true to me. i am wondering if it has something to do with the id instead which is an auto increment identity which i have left without value in my query. <strong>what am i doing wrong here </strong> some help will be appreciated.,sql
