appdomain.currentdomain.unhandledexception doesn t always fire up  i encountered an exception in our application that isn t handled at all. i really don t know what to look for to debug this problem since the application close immediately when this peculiar exception is thrown (even running from vs). the exception handling is setup that way:   <pre><code>[stathread] [loaderoptimizationattribute(loaderoptimization.multidomainhost)] static void main() { application.setunhandledexceptionmode(unhandledexceptionmode.catchexception); application.applicationexit += new eventhandler(applicationexithandler); application.threadexception += new threadexceptioneventhandler(threadexceptionhandler); appdomain.currentdomain.unhandledexception += new unhandledexceptioneventhandler(unhandledexceptionhandler); ... </code></pre>   the thread from which the exception is thrown is started that way:   <pre><code>thread executerthread = new thread(new threadstart(modele.exporter)); executerthread.setapartmentstate(apartmentstate.sta); executerthread.start(); </code></pre>   now  every unhandled exception thrown from that thread fire up our unhandledexceptionhandler except the one i have problems with. even if i catch the problematic exception and throw it again  the application closes silently. none of the 3 handlers (applicationexit  threadexception  unhandledexception) get fired (breakpoints not hit).    there is nothing so exceptional in that exception (see details here: <a href= http://pastebin.com/fcndrrij  rel= nofollow noreferrer >http://pastebin.com/fcndrrij</a>).,.net

accessing client s file system  can a web application access a file on client side     here s my scenario  i have a web service  which when called  stores the files in my content management server. currently  i am storing the file in the server where my application is hosted and then reading the file content as my web service accepts file content in bytes  and then calling the service to host the file. long story short  if a 2mb file takes 2 minutes to be stored on the server  it is taking 4 minutes now. can i access the file from client s machine directly rather storing it in the server and then reading it      i have gone through some previous posts: html5 file object - not supported in ie6 which is mandatory for me if a javascript function is used to read the file content  i still have to post back to the server to call the service is windows script host the answer for this  cause i have gone through some references  it doesnt seem so.,.net

applying for .net jobs as a  self learner   i have recently started applying for .net jobs. i currently work in a sales role with a large telco. i found out quite late that i like programming and as such bought my house and made commitments that mean college is not an option.    what i would like to know is  is it harder to get a junior job as a self learner  i have gotten a few enquiries regarding my c.v but nothing concrete yet. i try to be involved in projects as i get the chance and tend to put up any worthwhile projects as i develop them.    some examples of my work are:    a xaml lexer and parser: <a href= http://www.xlight.mendhak.com  rel= nofollow noreferrer >http://www.xlight.mendhak.com</a>    a font obfuscation tool: <a href= http://www.silverlightforums.com/showthread.php 1516-font-obsfucation-tool-alpha  rel= nofollow noreferrer >http://www.silverlightforums.com/showthread.php 1516-font-obsfucation-tool-alpha</a>    a tagger for m4a: <a href= http://projectaudiophile.codeplex.com/sourcecontrol/list/changesets  rel= nofollow noreferrer >http://projectaudiophile.codeplex.com/sourcecontrol/list/changesets</a>    i  of course think that these are great examples of my work but that is my opinion based on self learning. the other query is how much should i actually know  i ve never used linked lists but i know that strings are immutable and i understand what that means. i am only touching on t-sql but i understand things like how properties function in il (as two standard methods :) ). i suppose i understand a lot of concepts but specific features need some looking up to implement as i may not know the syntax off the top of my head.,.net

availability of 32-bit .net on a 64-bit os  <strong>tldr:</strong> when installing .net on a 64-bit os  are the 32-bit components always present     i used to have my app (<a href= http://ironscheme.codeplex.com/ >ironscheme</a>) compiled entirely as <code>anycpu</code>. while this works great for all platforms  the 64-bit jit compiler just seems too slow for my liking (about 550% slower startup and about 25% slower in general). the startup slowness can be solved by ngen ng my assemblies and does in fact improve startup time another odd 500% when done so. this is gives about a 2600% improvement on startup time (3700ms vs 140ms) on 64-bit. when both 32-bit and 64-bit are ngen d  the startup times are the same  but 32-bit still performs better at runtime.    now given in most cases 64-bit is not needed at all  i think targeting x86 in the executable would just be the best general solution (all the other assemblies are targeting <code>anycpu</code>  but from what i can see  the executable determines where it goes). so the idea is to to have 2 startup executables  one targeting x86  the other x64 (or amd64 as ms calls it).    when installing on a 32-bit os  i can be sure no 64-bit components are present. but what about the opposite case  does the .net installer install both 32-bit and 64-bit components  this is important as ngen ng a non-anycpu assembly will fail if the target does not match the runtime.    example:     <em> error compiling ironscheme.console.exe: this version of  is not compatible with the version of windows you re running. </em>    also note that my application is built by default for .net 2 and in vs2008  so the new <code>anycpu (32-bit preferred)</code> option (in vs2012/.net 4.5) is not an option for me at this time.    ps: sorry  if this has been asked before. i have no idea how to search for this specific issue  and my google fu failed me too.,.net

.net serialisation different frameworks  there is an error very simple to reproduce when serializing and deserializing with different .net frameworks (framework 2 and 4). when i serialize a system.globalization.compareinfo with framework 2 and try to deserialize it with framework 4 there will be an overflowexception. the code is as follows:   <pre><code>private void button1_click(object sender  eventargs e) {     compareinfo ci = compareinfo.getcompareinfo( de-de );      stream stream = file.open( c:\\temp\\test.bin   filemode.create);     binaryformatter formatter = new binaryformatter();     formatter.assemblyformat = system.runtime.serialization.formatters.formatterassemblystyle.simple;     formatter.typeformat = system.runtime.serialization.formatters.formattertypestyle.xsdstring;     formatter.serialize(stream  ci);     stream.close(); }  private void button2_click(object sender  eventargs e) {     stream stream = file.open( c:\\temp\\test.bin   filemode.open);     binaryformatter formatter = new binaryformatter();     compareinfo ci = (compareinfo)formatter.deserialize(stream);     stream.close(); } </code></pre>   when i do this with the same version (2 or 4) it works as expected. when i save the file with framework 2 and try to open it with framework 4 i will get the overflowexception.  now i am looking for a workaround (since there are thousands of files writen with framework 2.0 at our customers). i tried an approach like in <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2174591/net-c-how-to-add-a-custom-serialization-attribute-that-acts-as-iserializable >how to add a custom serialization attribute that acts as iserializable interface</a> but with no success.  any ideas     i am sorry  i omitted the two lines that made may code crash:   <pre><code>  formatter.assemblyformat = system.runtime.serialization.formatters.formatterassemblystyle.simple;   formatter.typeformat = system.runtime.serialization.formatters.formattertypestyle.xsdstring; </code></pre>   because i thought they were not necessary. now i updated the code and it is crashing. it doesn t help to include these lines when reading the file.,.net

automating dynamic windows forms controls client side  i have been researching this for hours and hours. at my company  i work in the qa department. i wrote a testing library using the automationelement classes in .net. the problem we are facing is that there is a panel control. inside of this control are buttons which we need to click upon. currently  we are using hard coded x y coordinates to move the mouse cursor and click the buttons.    from what i have read  dynamic controls cannot be detected inside the ui tree  unless the developer makes them visible by creating a custom panel control and then using the genericautomationpeer to make these dynamic controls visible. here is a link to the article i am referencing: <a href= http://www.colinsalmcorner.com/post/genericautomationpeer--helping-the-coded-ui-framework-find-your-custom-controls  rel= nofollow >http://www.colinsalmcorner.com/post/genericautomationpeer--helping-the-coded-ui-framework-find-your-custom-controls</a>    is there anyway to query the server or is there something i am just not aware of that can be done client side to get access to these controls  or is this just something the developers would have to implement so that we can access them. apparently  in our old testing software  qtp  these controls were some how accesible.    thank you  ryan,.net

.net working directory  paths  and imported html  i ve received some html with javascript from an external company that needs integrating with our .net project.    i have taken the approach of copying the html directly into a user control as the html changes infrequently. this caused an issue with the scripts as they refer to paths such as img/myimage.jpg and the working directory has changed as the page is part of our sitecore system. i have updated the images to use relative paths from the root directory e.g. /resources/img/myimage.jpg and this gets it mostly working.    this should work functionally but it doesn t function as expected and i cant identify the issue (no 404 issues).    so im thinking about alternatives: how can i import the html with the  working directory of the html maintained so the scripts continuing to work     thanks,.net

linkedlist or list or something else   i ve made a log parser which parses log files containing a lot of rows. the current implementation uses a <code>linkedlist&lt;t&gt;</code> to build a list of entries and is quite fast.    i ve also built a log viewer which uses a virtual list view. as you might understand it do not work very well with a linked list.    i m thinking about using the <code>linkedlist</code> when doing the initial parsing and then allocate a <code>list</code> when done (with capacity specified). then i simply use <code>addrange</code> to add the log entries to the list.    more new items will be added later on since i use a <code>filesystemwatcher</code> on the log file  but not in the same rate as the initial parsing.    is it a good idea to switch or do you have any better suggestions    <h2>update</h2>   the parsing is done by something that implements the following interface (one parser per log format).   <pre><code>public interface ilogparser     sub parse(byval stream as io.stream)     sub parse(byval stream as io.stream  byval offset as long)     event entryparsed(byval sender as object  byval e as parsedentryeventargs)     event completed(byval sender as object  byval e as eventargs) end interface </code></pre>   the logviewer subscribes on both events and adds each entry from the <code>entryparsed</code> event to the <code>linkedlist</code>. the <code>completed</code> event is triggered when the whole log (file)stream have been parsed.    when completed i start keeping track of the last position in the stream that was successfully parsed and the log parser method <code>parse(filestream  lastposition)</code> is called each time a <code>filesystemwatcher</code> event is triggered.,.net

automated processing using windows services/applications  in our company  we have a lot of services running on our main server. while i was studying each service  i noticed that most of it are the same application with different parameters. we have 600+ services but to sum it up  it should be 9 applications only. basically the same services were installed per client supplied with different parameters in the config file.    i am planning of trimming down the main services and just spool a separate process using console application for each client for every schedule or process demand.    i have tried this using a simple service and a console application for poc and it is working fine. i am just worried if the approach that i am thinking would have a problem in the long run. based on my poc  it shouldn t have any major issues aside from the timing which i am still working.    i don t know if this is off topic but i am asking for your advise masters. my idea is that  i wanted to avoid installing another instance for the same service for each client. this is a burden when your server encounters a problem and you will need to set up your services on another server. do you see a major drawback about the approach     please enlighten me.,.net

about .net software design philosophy  usually  when working with sdks and frameworks for mobile platforms  or open source webapp framework (like php -> <strong>cakephp</strong>  <strong>laravel</strong>  etc)  delegation of responsibilities is done by dividing classes into <strong>model</strong>  <strong>view</strong> and <strong>controller</strong> (mvc architecture). the pattern basically is to fill your <code>views</code> (let s say a <code>textview</code> (android) / <code>uitextview</code> (ios) / <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> (html from php) with your <strong>model</strong> class data.    it goes something like this: <code>textview.settext(mymodel.getfield())</code>    i m new to .net  i m actually learning it in my university in a software development course  and the first 2 things i noticed is that views are called <strong>controls</strong>. the second thing i noticed is that examples provided uses the <strong>controls</strong> themselves to manage data. maybe i m not explaining myself right  so i m going to give you an example:    in areas i d separate the <strong>view</strong> from the <strong>model</strong> and then get a reference to said model via the <strong>controller</strong> (lets say with a <code>store#getsalebyid(int saleid) : sale</code>   <pre><code>double calculatetotal(list&lt;sale&gt; mysale) {} </code></pre>   they pass directly the <strong>control</strong> as if it served as <strong>view and model</strong> and the operation is done by directly getting data from the <strong>control</strong>.   <pre><code>double calculatetotal(listbox listbox) {} </code></pre>   so i want to know what s the software design philosophy of .net  if it is use <strong>controls</strong> directly for operations like the examples i ve seen  or if those examples are wrong and <strong>controls</strong> are just views to present data to the user.,.net
how do i ensure my entire team has exactly the same version of the .net runtime   my team is writing an asp.net webapp in vs2008 targeting .net3.5 sp1. some of us have the .net runtime version <code>2.0.50727.3082</code> installed  and others have <code>2.0.50727.3053</code>. everyone s windows update reports no available updates  even the people with the lower build number  and i wouldn t care at all except that all <code>.designer.cs</code> files include the runtime version in their header  and the differing runtime versions cause spurious changes in source control. installing the very latest .net3.5 setup from microsoft doesn t address the issue - the .3053 version is still installed  even after the runtime is  repaired .    in the short term  how do i upgrade from .3053 to .3082  and in the medium term how do i ensure my entire team is on the same .net runtime version,.net

what does the .net framework do during a blocking call   i m observing some strange behavior in my code and i m trying to track down the source.  i have two single threaded .net applications running and sending wcf messages to each other on the same machine.  they are very simple  there is a blocking write and then a blocking read.  i have noticed that on my blocking call in my log  99.99% of the time i read / write in ~10 ms.  however in very rare circumstances  it may take 500-2000 ms.  i m trying to understand exactly why this might be.  i have a few odd quirks to my app that i am tracking down and may be the culprit  but i was wondering if this was entering into territory where there s something about the framework that i don t understand.      so my question is this  when there s something like a blocking call  does a .net application start running a background process (such as garbage collection) while the main thread of execution is blocked     thank you for your time.,.net

will there ever be a solution for global events in .net applications  in our program we use microsoft s useractivityhook.dll to determine when a user of our windows forms app has been idle for more than x seconds.  this allows us to replicate an  auto-away  behavior much like msn/live messanger when there has been no keyboard or mouse events after a certain amount of time.    ive always wondered why .net (to my knowledge) has not implemented a way to interact with such global events.  it seems that the filesystemwatcher class is similar  in that it notifies the program of file changes that occur outside the program  why not a similar function for mouse/keyboard events,.net

what is the advantage that wrapping the request from web browser to server in an object  i read in the 70-515 book that  by wrapping the http request in a programmable object  asp.net provides your code access to things such as the cookies associated with your site  the query string parameters passed with the url  and the path to the requested resource  and allows you to work with other relevant request-based information.    but how it is possible by wrapping into an object gives you access to cookies etc..  can any one please explain....,.net

is .net already the right way to go for small app development   i am developing a small windows app  but have some trouble deciding whether to use .net or not. as a coder i would like to make use of the .net libraries. on the other hand  requiring my users to download the gargantuan .net runtime seems like a horrible decision.    a 100 meg prerequisite might be alright for software in the scale of visual studio  but i feel like it would be a deal breaker for quick lightweight tools (think  for example  notepad++). in the future  the .net runtimes will likely become widespread enough to eradicate the problem  but in the short run  i feel uneasy.    in your opinion/experience  is 2009 too early for a small app to go .net  should i wait for the bigger players to pave the way     <em>edit: which versions  if any  come by default with xp sp2 and vista </em>,.net

if an app gives me the system.argumentoutofrangeexception  does that mean it is a bug in the app   i have this problem with an app of a printer. i need to know if it is an error in my installation or a bug in the app. i think it is a bug (programmer didn t catch this exception)  and i suspect this app is made in c# and they didn t noticed the uncaught exception when they upgraded their printers (the fact is that they added a character in the printer s and the driver s name  and the exception was thrown because of the driver s name).,.net

are .net applications immune from classic pointer errors   does some article or proof exist that .net applications are immune to low level errors      i m talking about the classic pointer errors we can see in a c++ application  memory overflow  problems from the intel <a href= http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nx_bit  rel= nofollow noreferrer >dep</a> and so on.    i m talking about .net applications that do not use  unsafe  code  from what is my experience in this case only problems can be that of a memory leak or classic coding errors (like stack overflows) but i ve never seen low level errors.    could someone comment on this,.net

trigonometry calculator radians to degrees and vice versa in .net  i m quite new to programming and was unable to find an answer on these forums to the question i have.    i am using vb.net and i want to put together a program that can convert degrees to radians (and vice versa)  while the angle is calculated.    so in other words  there are two text boxes and  one button. the button is  sin x.  the text boxes have labels next to them:  degrees  and  radians.     let s say you enter a value for degrees and click  for example   sin x.  from there  the program takes the value you entered  converts it to radians  calculates the sin of that converted value  and showcases it in the  radians  text box. the idea is for you to also be able to put in a value inside the  radians  text box  the program converts it to degrees  takes the sin of converted value  and outputs it on the  degrees text box.     i succeed in getting degrees converted to radians  calculated  and put out on the radians text box  however i have hit a brick wall and am confused as to how i can have values be put in the radians text box  converted to degrees  and put out on the degrees text box.    here s the code i have so far:   <pre><code>public class trigonometryconverter      private sub btnsin_click(sender as object  e as eventargs) handles btnsin.click         dim input  input2 as double         dim output  soutput  output2  soutput2 as double         const cfactor as double = (math.pi) / 180         input = convert.todouble(tbxd.text)         input2 = convert.todouble(tbxr.text)         output = input * cfactor         output2 = input2 / cfactor         soutput = math.sin(output)         soutput2 = math.sin(output2)         tbxr.text = convert.tostring(soutput)         tbxd.text = convert.tostring(soutput2)      end sub end class </code></pre>   tbxd.text is the text box where  degrees  values are put in and out. tbxr.text is the text box where  radian  values are put in and out.    the program with the code above does not work at all  however  i can have the program work partially where degrees switch to radians  are calculated  and put out if i use the code below:   <pre><code>public class trigonometryconverter      private sub btnsin_click(sender as object  e as eventargs) handles btnsin.click         dim input as double         dim output  soutput as double         const cfactor as double = (math.pi) / 180         input = convert.todouble(tbxd.text)         output = input * cfactor         soutput = math.sin(output)         tbxr.text = convert.tostring(soutput)      end sub end class </code></pre>   tl;dr version: i have a program and want to have both text boxes take in values input and put out calculated values.    any suggestions/solutions  thanks!,.net
decimal.tryparse() drops leading  1   short and sweet version:    on one machine out of around a hundred test machines decimal.tryparse() is converting  1.01  to 0.01   <hr>   okay  this is going to sound crazy but bear with me...    we have a client applications that communicates with a webservice through json  and that service returns a decimal value as a string so we store it as a string in our model object:   <pre><code>[datamember(name =  value )] public string value { get; set; } </code></pre>   when we display that value on screen it is formatted to a specific number of decimal places. so the process we use is string -> decimal then decimal -> string.    the application is currently undergoing final testing and is running on more than 100 machines  where this all works fine. however on <em>one</em> machine if the decimal value has a leading  1  then it is replaced by a zero. i added simple logging to the code so it looks like this:   <pre><code>log( original string value: {0}   value); decimal val; if (decimal.tryparse(value  out val)) {     log( parsed decimal value: {0}   val);     string output = val.tostring(format  cultureinfo.invariantculture.numberformat);     log( formatted string value: {0}   output);     return output; } </code></pre>   on my machine - any every other client machine - the logfile output is:   <blockquote>   <ul>   <li>original string value: 1.010000</li>   <li>parsed decimal value: 1.010000</li>   <li>formatted string value: 1.01</li>   </ul> </blockquote>   on the defective machine the output is:   <blockquote>   <ul>   <li>original string value: 1.010000</li>   <li>parsed decimal value: 0.010000</li>   <li>formatted string value: 0.01</li>   </ul> </blockquote>   so it would appear that the decimal.tryparse method is at fault.    things we ve tried:   <ul> <li>uninstalling and reinstalling the client application</li> <li>uninstalling and reinstalling .net 3.5 sp1</li> <li>comparing the defective machine s regional settings for numbers (using english (united kingdom)) to those of a working machine - no differences.</li> </ul>   has anyone seen anything like this or has any suggestions  i m quickly running out of ideas...   <hr>   while i was typing this some more info came in: passing a string value of  10000  to convert.toint32() returns 0  so that also seems to drop the leading 1.   <hr>   further tests based on comments:   <ul> <li>1.01 -> 0.01</li> <li>111.01 -> 11.01</li> <li>123.01 -> 23.01</li> <li>231.01 -> 231.01</li> <li>01.01 -> 1.01</li> </ul>   so it would appear that it only affects 1s and only if they are the first character of the string. very odd  but at least it s consistent.,.net

attaching meta-information to an object in .net  i m pretty sure this is a duplicate question  but i can t find the original(s).    i am getting some objects that i need to  attach  some information to. basically  if that object ever gets back to the same piece of code  i need to see that i have seen it before.    ie. something like this:   <pre><code>dictionary&lt;weakreference&lt;objecttype&gt;  string&gt; _cache; </code></pre>   note the weak reference in there (i know weakreference is not generic btw)  i need to make the key of the cache a weak reference  to handle the fact that the objects are gc ed out of my control.    now  i can make that cache full of weak references  but i seem to recall a similar type of system already existing in .net  which was gc ed automatically alongside the object.    note that i do not recall the overhead of this  so i will make sure to read up on the subject before deciding if this is a good/better solution than my own cache. unfortunately i cannot change the object in question  so i need to keep track of this meta-information somewhere else.    my limitations:   <ul> <li>the object is not mine  so i cannot change it in any way possible</li> <li>i cannot inherit from the object  as it is sealed  besides  i m <em>given</em> the objects  i do not construct them  so i would have to be able to replace an instance with a new object of a descendant type for this to be useful</li> <li>the objects are gc ed out of my control  so i cannot just use a dictionary  which will slowly fill up  either with  references  to nonexistant objects  or will hold on to the objects  i would need a dictionary with a weak referenced key (thus: custom dictionary)</li> <li>the objects  although i could encapsulate them within my own code and thus carry alongside it the required information  is passed back to a framework out of my control  and given back to me from the same  and thus i need to be able to retrieve/look up the old information with just the object in question</li> </ul>   basically  something like:   <pre><code>propertyattacher.attach(instance   name   name); </code></pre>   do i remember correctly  what are the classes involved,.net
how to verify an assembly was signed by my organization   i ve reviewed the .net strong name process a few times and think i m comfortable with it  but i m left with what i think is a security gap:    i m working on a system whereby we store serialized .net assemblies in our ms sql database. they are read by a public-facing web application that deserializes and caches them. this is done to allow remote addition of new plugins without having to redeploy the web app.    i have some concerns about author verification  however. both the web app and the plugin assemblies have strong names using the same public-private key. in that way i m guaranteed that the plugins can t be tampered with  but i see one scenario in which a malicious user could execute their own code:   <ol> <li>the user implements an assembly that implements the interface our plugins are using (this is nontrivial since the plugins are not distributed - we create them internally).</li> <li>the user gives this assembly a strong name of their own</li> <li>the user manages to inject their assembly into the appropriate table in our database</li> <li>the web application loads this assembly and instantiates the constructor for the interface the malicious user implemented - it is now executing their code</li> </ol>   it s my understanding that the .net framework will only check that an assembly has a strong name and that it hasn t been tampered with - it doesn t say anything about verification of the author.    thus  the last piece of my puzzle is to somehow verify that the signature in an assembly is in fact our own. am i missing some fundamental piece that s already been addressed  or is strong naming not designed to handle this case  if so  can anyone suggest how to address this problem     [edit] thanks khalid! my problem was that one of my test plugins was signed using a test key - i had since regenerated it (don t ask) and applied it to the other assemblies but missed that one. as a result  i thought that getpublickey() was returning inconsistent values!    code snippet for anyone who is following this path:   <pre><code>private bool validateassembly( byte[] deserializedassembly ){    byte[] ourkey = assembly.getexecutingassembly().getname().getpublickey();    for (int i=0; i &lt; deserializedassembly.length; i++){       if ( deserializedassembly[i] != outkey[i] )          return false;     }     return true; } </code></pre>   (any error handling or non-public key checks removed for clarity)    note this works as long as the executing assembly (web app) and plugins are signed using the same key. this works for us internally but if your plugin api is public you d need a different way of managing trust.,.net

net framework vs. sdk downloads  hi i m trying to set up a build server for net projects and am confused about certain things. i m coming from a java background so need to know the difference in the net packaging strategies.    as far as i m aware  the <code>framework</code> is equivalent to the jre in java  while the <code>net sdk</code> is equivalent to the java sdk. is this correct  because  when i search for the <code>net sdk</code> the framework pages are shown  and (from the <a href= http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx displaylang=en&amp;id=17718  rel= nofollow noreferrer >net 4.0 framework download page</a>)  it states that <em> the microsoft .net framework 4 redistributable package installs the .net framework runtime and associated files that are required to run and develop applications to target the .net framework 4 </em>.    also  as it s a cloud based build server  i want to keep the amount of crap i install to a minimum  and the sdk iso is over a gb in size (hope it only installs selectively).    ps. i know this question is similar to <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5300089/confused-about-net-redistributable-packages-and-sdk >this one</a>  but i m still confused.,.net
creating cryptographically secure passwords in .net framework  i needed 3 unique passwords for 3 database connection strings  so i hacked together the following as part of a winforms application:   <pre><code>rngcryptoserviceprovider rng = new rngcryptoserviceprovider(); void charcount_textchanged(object sender  system.eventargs e) {     int nochars;     if (int.tryparse(charcount.text  out nochars))     {         byte[] random = new byte[nochars-1];         rng.getbytes(random);         outputtxt.text = convert.tobase64string(random);     } } </code></pre>   however  if i enter 8 for the number of characters  i get something like  igtjeqptvq==   which is 12 characters  and every string seems to end in  ==     can someone please explain both why the number of characters is greater than the size of the byte array  and also why the strings seem to regularly end in ==.    forgive how amateur this question is  and thank you for your explanations.,.net

.net exception. application code to blame  or .net itself   i m not a .net developer  but we have a company who developed an application with .net that is constantly crashing. in the event log  we see many crash dumps. below is one of them. basically  the developer is saying that it is a .net issue and not their code  but from what i know about coding  the exception is saying that they are not handling an exception correctly. i don t know enough to refute them. can anyone offer insight as to what the issue might (really) be (i don t trust the developer  as their product has been horrendous throughout the process)  or what parts of the message might indicate that it is an issue that the developer needs to deal with  and not microsoft (or  if the error dictates  the reverse)  thanks in

how to reserve public api to internal usage in .net   i have objects and collections  which should support the merge api (it is my custom api  the signature of which is immaterial for this question). this api must be internal  meaning only my framework should be allowed to invoke it. however  derived types should be able to override the basic implementation.    the natural way to implement this pattern as i see it  is this:   <ol> <li>the merge api is declared as part of some <code>internal</code> interface  let us say <code>imergeable</code>.</li> <li>because the interface is <code>internal</code>  derived types would not be able to implement it directly. rather they must inherit it from a common base type. so  a common base type is introduced  which would implement the <code>imergeable</code> interface explicitly  where the interface methods delegate to respective protected virtual methods  providing the default implementation. this way the api is only callable by my framework  but derived types may override the default implementation.</li> </ol>   the following code snippet demonstrates the concept:   <pre><code>internal interface imergeable {   void merge(object obj); }  public class baseframeworkobject : imergeable {   protected virtual void merge(object obj)   {     // the default implementation.   }    void imergeable.merge(object obj)   {     merge(obj);   } }  public class somethirdpartyobject : baseframeworkobject {   protected override void merge(object obj)   {     // a derived type implementation.   } } </code></pre>   all is fine  provided a single common base type suffices  which is usually true for non collection types.     the thing is that collections must be mergeable as well. collections do not play nicely with the presented concept  because developers do not develop collections from the scratch. there are predefined implementations - observable  filtered  compound  read-only  remove-only  ordered  god-knows-what  ... they may be developed from scratch in-house  but once finished  they serve wide range of products and should never be tailored to some specific product. which means  that either:   <ul> <li>they do not implement the <code>imergeable</code> interface at all  because it is <code>internal</code> to some product</li> <li>the scope of the <code>imergeable</code> interface is raised to <code>public</code> and the api becomes open and callable by all.</li> </ul>   let us refer to these collections as standard collections. anyway  the first option screws my framework  because now each possible standard collection type has to be paired with the respective framework version  augmenting the standard with the <code>imergeable</code> interface implementation - this is so bad  i am not even considering it.    the second option breaks the framework as well  because the <code>imergeable</code> interface should be <code>internal</code> for a reason (whatever it is) and now this interface has to open to all.    so what to do     my solution is this. make <code>imergeable</code> public api  but add an extra parameter to the <code>merge</code> method  i call it a security token. the interface implementation may check that the token references some internal object  which is never exposed to the outside. if this is the case  then the method was called from within the framework  otherwise - some outside api consumer attempted to invoke it and so the implementation can blow up with a <code>securityexception</code>.    here is the modified code snippet demonstrating this concept:   <pre><code>internal static class internalapi {   internal static readonly object token = new object(); }  public interface imergeable {   void merge(object obj  object token); }  public class baseframeworkobject : imergeable {   protected virtual void merge(object obj)   {     // the default implementation.   }    public void merge(object obj  object token)   {     if (!object.referenceequals(token  internalapi.token))     {       throw new securityexception( bla bla bla );     }      merge(obj);   } }  public class somethirdpartyobject : baseframeworkobject {   protected override void merge(object obj)   {     // a derived type implementation.   } } </code></pre>   of course  this is less explicit than having an internally scoped interface and the check is moved from the compile time to run time  yet this is the best i could come up with.    now  i have a gut feeling that there is a better way to solve the problem i have presented. i do not know  may be using some standard code access security features  i have only vague understanding of it  but can linkdemand attribute be somehow related to it  anyway  i would like to hear other opinions.,.net

confused about .net redistributable packages and sdk  1.    assuming that you don t have visual studio installed and you want to use command line for development  do you need the .net framework sdk     the reason for my confusion is that the description for the redistributable says  the microsoft .net framework 4 redistributable package installs the .net framework runtime and associated files that are required to run <strong>and develop</strong> applications to target the .net framework 4.     in this case  why is the sdk needed     2.    if i understand correctly  the rational behind the introduction of the client profile flavor of the redist was to have a smaller installation. yet  it seems to be merely 15% smaller (41 mb vs 48 mb  see links below). is it really worth it     links:<br> <a href= http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx displaylang=en&amp;familyid=e5ad0459-cbcc-4b4f-97b6-fb17111cf544  rel= nofollow >client profile redist</a><br> <a href= http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx familyid=0a391abd-25c1-4fc0-919f-b21f31ab88b7  rel= nofollow >full redist</a><br> <a href= http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx familyid=35aeda01-421d-4ba5-b44b-543dc8c33a20  rel= nofollow >sdk</a>,.net

common audit table for all entities  need an opinion    do you think its a good idea storing basic audit information for all entities in a common database table  i mean created by  created on  modified by  modified on. the entity table will have the audit id &amp; timestamp     audit information is typically queried during updates to check conflicts and sometimes from business logic associated with the creator for e.g. owner of the record in a crm new lead row.     may be we should never use audit fields as business fields.    i think it will make the inserts slow because of two tables per entity but overall will make the entity classes compact and will make auditing a on/off switch,.net
best practice with table jonction  entites  i search the best practice for create an entity on a kind of situation.    there s a sample:    we have 4 tables in a database.   <pre><code>table server id name ...  table environment id name  table application id name ...  table jct_application_server_environment idapplication idserver idenvironment </code></pre>   we have 3 tables linked by 1 table(jct_application_server_environment)    my system (in asp.net) need to show the list of  server  for an application.    so  should i use an entity like :    <em><strong>v1</em></strong>   <pre><code>class jct_application_server_environment public idapplication public idserver public idenvironment </code></pre>   and for each item i load the server and environment. that will be  difficult  with a datagrid to load every time. for my purpose  i think that s not the good things to do.   <hr>   or did its better to create an entity  :    <em><strong>v2</em></strong>   <pre><code>class jct_application_server_environment     public applicationname     public serveurname     public environmentname </code></pre>   you have what you need. simple  take the minimum.  if you need more  take more time to do.    if you have a lot of properties  its will take time to do the entity. and every properties are already created in another entites (the original application/server/environment).   <hr>   or maybe     <em><strong>v3</em></strong>   <pre><code>class jct_application_server_environment     public application //as application entity     public server     //as server entity     public environment //as environment entity  sub new(row as datarow) //each new do a getelementbyid on database    me.application = new application(row( idapplication ))    me.server = new server (row( idserver  ))    me.environment = new environment (row( idenvironment  )) </code></pre>   take time to load at first but get what you need and maybe more. datagrid just need to know to take the sub value (server.name/environment.name)   <hr>   the first one is used mostly on import/export system. for webview its not the version i usely used because i prefer to go easy on gridview databound.    the second is used more often but the entity is for only one thing. 1 entity for 1 gridview. the actual situation fit for the second version. i just want to know if its better the second or the third. what developper with .net experience uselly do.    if you have any other options  you can post-it as an answer.   <hr>   for my actual project  i decided to use v3 but only for the container. the data is fill by a dal.    dal do something like    <pre><code>function getlist() as list(of jct_application_server_environment)  get list of application_server_environment containing id s  for each item grab application  server and envirenment by id create a new jct_application_server_environment with those 3 add to list of jct_application_server_environment  return list </code></pre>,.net

how to retrieve the output of a .net project without the dependencies  when one builds a .net project  the output is copied into an output folder (e.g.: the bin folder); not only the binaries issued from the project s source code are copied  but also all the dependencies (file references) marked with the option copylocal=true.    for the purpose of a custom build task (i.e.: when compiling on team build) i would like to know how get the list of binaries issued from a build without those dependencies (i may not -  and don t want anyway - to set copylocal=false).    my issue is that i didn t find a clean way to determined this output. the closest solution i have is to loop on the project files  read the assemblyname and check if there are pdb  xml  resx files foreseen. but still  i am sometimes missing resource files ( ) and maybe other outputs as i don t know all the possible items.    so my question is: do you know any methods/tricks/algorithms to get the list of binaries issued by a build; i.e. assemblies  satellite assemblies (+ path of their subfolders)  pbd  xml (i.e.: documentation) but without the dependencies,.net

what should i expect from calling `cancel` on `printeventargs` from `printdocument`   i had to modify the print feature in our application in order to not print some specific pages. the only way i found that didn t requires heavy modifications was to recycle the page (i only know if the page need to be skipped after i  printed  it so i clear this page i use it again for the next). the problem is when the page i need to recycle is the last one i end up with a blank page for which i have no use. the clever trick i do at that point is to call <code>cancel</code> on <code>printeventargs</code> which effectively seems to cancel only the last page. is that guaranteed to always be the case or i run the risk of cancelling more than the last page under some specific circumstances (ex: slow spooler)  i don t have any other fix in mind.,.net

changing a property into a method - any side effects   i have a class that has some properties. and i want something that calculates a score out of these properties. since this is a trivial task (some additions and divisions  but nothing spectacular).    so naturally  the question is:  when to use a property with some code in the getter  and when to use a function    and <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67063/ >that question was already answered</a>.    now  i wonder about one thing though: if - against all expectations - i ever needed to make this getter so complicated that it should be a function (for example  because i need to put data in or because it can throw an exception or whatever)  is it easy to change a property into a method     of course  it seems really trivial  just changing   <pre><code>public double score {     get {         return math.round(a + b / c * d 3);     } } </code></pre>   to   <pre><code>public double score(){     return math.round(a + b / c * d 3); } </code></pre>   but i wonder: are there any side effects  is anything going to break when changing stuff around like this  i can only ever see this as a possible problem when reflection is involved  but what in situations where i have 2 assemblies - one that defines the class and one that uses the class - and only change the one that contains the class without recompiling the consumer assembly. is that a possible source of  weird bugs that are nearly impossible to track  or is it completely safe to change properties to methods,.net

looking to emulate the functionality of robocopy in a .net application  robocopy is a great command line tool for mirroring two folders. we have a requirement to wrap up the same functionality in a bigger .net application. it s part of our archiving system for the file server which identifies which folders haven t been modified for a year and moves them to another folder location.    i know i could shell out to robocopy but it would be neater if we could do it all from within the .net app  e.g. for error trapping.    the .net framework has all the basics for this but i wondered if anyone knew of a 3rd party library that offered more powerful synchronisation functions  to save us re-inventing the wheel. it also needs to be robust so chances are a more well established library would fair better that our own 1st version attempt.    thanks  rob.,.net

.net data transformation (one object type to another) - looping  i ve been banging my head against this problem for a couple of hours now  if anyone here can offer any pointers i would be grateful. i think i am now snow blinded by this one so a fresh set of brain cells will probably see a really simple solution!    basically  i have some data i am pulling from a legacy database that needs to be transformed into our stock management system by constructing our own stock object.    the simplified model is shown below:   <pre><code>public class stock     public property attributes as list(of stockattribute) end class  public class stockattribute     public property attributename as string     public property attributevalue as string end class </code></pre>   the source data comes in as this object:   <pre><code>public class sourceoption     public property optionname as string     public property optionvalue as string end class </code></pre>   some sample data can be constructed using these methods:   <pre><code>function getsourcelist1() as list(of sourceoption)       prepare the source data     dim options as new list(of sourceoption)      dim opt as new sourceoption     opt.optionname =  size      opt.optionvalue =  small       dim opt2 as new sourceoption     opt.optionname =  size      opt.optionvalue =  medium       dim opt3 as new sourceoption     opt.optionname =  size      opt.optionvalue =  large       dim opt4 as new sourceoption     opt.optionname =  colour      opt.optionvalue =  black       dim opt5 as new sourceoption     opt.optionname =  colour      opt.optionvalue =  purple        options.add(opt)     options.add(opt2)     options.add(opt3)     options.add(opt4)     options.add(opt5)      return (options)  end function   function getsourcelist2() as list(of sourceoption)       prepare the source data     dim options as new list(of sourceoption)      dim opt as new sourceoption     opt.optionname =  size      opt.optionvalue =  40       dim opt2 as new sourceoption     opt.optionname =  size      opt.optionvalue =  41       dim opt3 as new sourceoption     opt.optionname =  size      opt.optionvalue =  42        options.add(opt)     options.add(opt2)     options.add(opt3)      return (options)  end function  function getsourcelist3() as list(of sourceoption)       prepare the source data     dim options as new list(of sourceoption)      dim opt as new sourceoption     opt.optionname =  size      opt.optionvalue =  small       dim opt2 as new sourceoption     opt.optionname =  size      opt.optionvalue =  large       dim opt3 as new sourceoption     opt.optionname =  colour      opt.optionvalue =  red       dim opt4 as new sourceoption     opt.optionname =  colour      opt.optionvalue =  blue       dim opt5 as new sourceoption     opt.optionname =  style      opt.optionvalue =  a       dim opt6 as new sourceoption     opt.optionname =  style      opt.optionvalue =  b       options.add(opt)     options.add(opt2)     options.add(opt3)     options.add(opt4)     options.add(opt5)     options.add(opt6)      return (options)  end function </code></pre>   so  my  convert  method needs to take the sourceoption lists and construct stock lists (with attributes) as explained here:    sub convert()   <pre><code> we need to convert the sourceoption list (in getsourcelist) into a list of stock  each with a list of stockattribute. so in the case of getsourcelist1 we would have  six stock objects  each stock object containing two stockattribute objects (one for colour and one for size):   stock1 - attribute1: size:small attribute2: colour:black  stock2 - attribute1: size:medium attribute2: colour:black  stock3 - attribute1: size:large attribute2: colour:black  stock4 - attribute1: size:small attribute2: colour:purple  stock5 - attribute1: size:medium attribute2: colour:purple  stock6 - attribute1: size:large attribute2: colour:purple   in the case of getsourcelist2 we would have three stock objects with only one stockattribute each (for size):   stock1 - attribute1: size:40  stock2 - attribute1: size:41  stock3 - attribute1: size:42   in the case of getsourcelist3 we would have eigth stock objects with three stockattribute each (for size  colour and style):   stock1 - attribute1: size:small attribute2: colour:red attribute3: style:a  stock2 - attribute1: size:large attribute2: colour:red attribute3: style:a  stock3 - attribute1: size:small attribute2: colour:blue attribute3: style:a  stock4 - attribute1: size:large attribute2: colour:blue attribute3: style:a  stock5 - attribute1: size:small attribute2: colour:red attribute3: style:b  stock6 - attribute1: size:large attribute2: colour:red attribute3: style:b  stock7 - attribute1: size:small attribute2: colour:blue attribute3: style:b  stock8 - attribute1: size:large attribute2: colour:blue attribute3: style:b </code></pre>   end sub    i do hope that s clear  and any feedback would really be appreciated before i tear all of my hair out!    thanks carl,.net
.net framework - when to upgrade   i’m faced with a challenge of leading two (currently) separate .net development groups with different development strategies.  one group is developing on the .net framework 2.0 (with maybe a few applications on 3.5).  the other group immediately adopts any new framework that comes out  and begins coding any new applications with it (they are running 2.0-4.0 applications).  for this last group  applications written in an earlier version than the latest framework do not get upgraded.    what is the current school of thought when it comes to a company developing web applications on when to adopt a new framework  and whether to migrate applications built on previous versions to the latest framework or not   years ago the thought was to wait until the technology became mainstream - but that doesn t seem to apply much now with .net.,.net

how to force an outofmemoryexception in .net  sometimes it s helpful to get an application into a bad situation to see how it responds.  things like unplugging the network cable or removing power will show me how resilient my application is and where i have work to do.    to this end  i m trying to figure out what the fastest way to force an <code>outofmemoryexception</code> in .net.  doing it in a simple console application will allow me to inject this scenario into a running application.  there are obviously other things that need to be considered when dealing with <code>outofmemoryexceptions</code> (e.g. memory fragmentation and how the garbage collector has allocated the different generations) but that s not important for the scope of this experiment.    <strong>update</strong><br> to clarify the purpose of the question  it s important to note that simply throwing an out of memory exception isn t helpful since i want to see how the program will react when the memory pressure is increased.  in essence  i want to stimulate the gc into an aggressive collection mode and monitor how that impacts the performance until the process dies from an out of memory exception.,.net

is there a class for holding a file system path   in the .net base class library there is a class system.io.path for doing common operations on strings representing a file system path. however  what i need is <b>a class that encapsulates a path</b> instead  so i get type-safety and a possibly shorter notation of path operations. i m thinking of a .net equivalent of <a href= http://www.boost.org/  rel= nofollow noreferrer >c++ boost s</a> path class. does such a class exist       <b>update</b>: i m not necessarily looking for a class that can hold <b>both file and directory paths</b>. however  as a file system path can be used for pointing to both  i find it obvious that same class can be used.    <b>conclusion</b>: <em>directoryinfo</em> and <em>fileinfo</em> come close to what i m looking for. however  they seem to be intended as a representation of a file or directory  rather than a file or directory path. this makes it <b>difficult to do path operations</b>  such as <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2026991/combining-a-directoryinfo-and-a-fileinfo-path >combining a directory path and a relative file path</a>  so i think i ll write a class that encapsulates a path.,.net

why structs cannot have extern properties  but methods are ok   observe the following code:   <pre><code>[attributeusage(attributetargets.all)] public class xattribute : attribute { }  public struct a {   [x]   public static extern int xx { get; } } </code></pre>   this does not compile. the error message says    <blockquote>    the modifier  extern  is not valid for   this item  </blockquote>   but  the following code compiles ok:   <pre><code>[attributeusage(attributetargets.all)] public class xattribute : attribute { }  public struct a {   [x]   public static extern int getxx(); } </code></pre>   why        <strong>edit</strong>    guys  guys. i would not have asked had i not had a real application for this. i understand  that purely academic interest to understand why some things are defined the way they are is not something that motivates some of us  so here is the down to earth motivation. i have a postsharp attribute  that injects a certain logic into the attributed extern property. specifically  the real code looks like so:   <pre><code>[loggeraccessproperty] private static extern ilog logger { get; } </code></pre>   where postsharp processes the loggeraccessproperty aspect and injects the actual getter method  which surfaces the private static compiler generated ilog instance. this is part of our in-house extension of the log4postsharp package. at the time  we have published the extended version of log4postsharp at the postsharp google code site and this attribute is my recent addition  yet unpublished.    <strong>edit2</strong>    note  that the following code compiles just fine:   <pre><code>[attributeusage(attributetargets.all)] public class xattribute : attribute { }  public class a {   [x]   public static extern int xx { get; } } </code></pre>   the difference is that a is a class here  not struct.    <strong>edit3</strong>    i am using .net 4.,.net

determining assemblies/dlls that a .net executable calls by looking at msil   this might seem like a bit of an odd question  and i hope i ve got my terminology correct...    is there any way to determine what assemblies or other external .dlls are called by examining the msil of a .net app   if so  is it possible to see what function calls are made to those external assemblies or dlls     the reason i ask is so:    from the little bit of .net mobile development i ve done so far  it seems that often a programmer must explicitly state the capabilities that the application requires.  for example  suppose a person is writing a .net app for the windows phone platform that requires access to the accelerometer  he/she must explicitly state that the app requires accelerometer use.  it seems like this whole process could potentially be automated by analyzing the include statements of the original source code.  for example  if the line  using microsoft.devices.sensors  is in the source code  that the app most likely requires use of the accelerometer  compass  or light sensor.  the list of requirements for app could then be generated based on the include statements in the source code  rather than having to depend on a programmer specifying things.  so  in the description of the app  it could say  this app requires access this device s sensors.   the problem with doing that is that obviously the source code isn t submitted to the app store.    from the tiny bit of windows 8 dev i ve done  i ve noticed that metro-style apps for windows 8 (or for the windows marketplace) are forbidden from calling external dlls as well as certain other system calls.  this is enforced at compile/build time when the app is being generated.  as an extra security measure  the same sort of technique - examining the msil to determine what external assemblies/dlls are being called could be used as an extra security measure to make sure that no potentially un-sandboxed apps end up on the app store.    since this isn t already being done  i m guessing that it s not possible  but i figured it never hurts to ask.  it just seems like such a slick way of determining what an app really needs access to  rather than relying on a potentially sloppy programmer that has decided to require all capabilities for a particular app that doesn t actually use them.,.net

is it appropriate to store all forms and threads inside a custom applicationcontext class   i m trying to figure out a way to divide the ui from the business logic. in addition  i want the business logic to be able to notify the ui of updates easily without having to pass a reference to a form all over the business logic or something like that. i found the applicationcontext class and it seems like it would allow me to store all forms and threads in a higher level class. it just seems odd that the main form contains handles to different threads and other forms. is it appropriate to put all of this in applicationcontext  i was thinking about making it a singleton as well so that the business logic can easily notify the ui. thanks!,.net

how does a value type actually work in .net   somewhat academic question  but: how do value types like int actually <em>work</em>     i ve used reflector on mscorlib to find out how system.int32 is implemented  and it s just a struct that inherits from system.valuetype. i was looking for something among the lines of an array of bits holding the value  but i only found a field that s declared int - which means it s a circular reference     i mean  i can write  int i = 14;   but the number 14 needs to be stored somewhere somehow  but i couldn t find the  array of 32-bits  or a pointer or something.    is this some magic that the compiler does  and are these magic types part of the specification  (similar to how system.attribute or system.exception are  special  types)    <strong>edit:</strong> if i declare my own struct  i add fields to it. those fields are of a built-in type  for example int. so the clr knows that i hold an int. but how does it know that an int is 32-bits  signed  is it simply that the specification specifies certain base types and therefore makes them  magic   or is there a technical mechanism  hypothetical example: if i would want to declare an int36  that is an integer with 36 bits  could i create a type that works <em>exactly</em> like an int32 (apart from the 4 extra bits ofc) by specifying  okay  set aside 36 bits   or are the built-in primitives set in stone and i would have to somehow work around this (i.e. by using an int64 and code that only sets the last 36 bits)     as said  all very academic and hypothetical  but i always wondered about that.,.net

net 2.0: can i set settings filename   i have a windows (not web) net 1.1 app which can accept the settings file as its argument; this way i can easily switch between (e.g.) different connection strings just by passing a different settings file.    i understand that in net 2.0 settings manager has been made simpler: we can define it at design-time and easily access its properties at design/run-time; but this imposes me to always use that particular configuration file  with no chance (as far as i understood) to have the flexibility to pass one or another configuration file accordingly to the circumstancies.    i would like to be able to have a settings class which initializes itself just the way it does it now (app.config file in the default dir)  but can be redirected to another file for read/write operations  like:   <pre><code>my.settings.use(*filenamewithfullpathandextensions*) </code></pre>   so my question is: is there a way to do something like this     thanks in advance to anyone will help,.net

.net framework bug: system.net.mail.attachmentbase disposes of streams it did t create  before submitting this as a bug  i wanted to get community feedback to see if this should be considered a bug.    when creating a <code>linkedresource</code> or other class that derives from <code>attachmentbase</code>  there are constructor overloads that take either a <a href= https://referencesource.microsoft.com/#system/net/system/net/mail/attachment.cs 0a9d3f581698a5b7 references  rel= nofollow noreferrer >file name</a> or a <a href= https://referencesource.microsoft.com/#system/net/system/net/mail/attachment.cs 5072a46ba8103c1e references  rel= nofollow noreferrer ><code>stream</code></a>. when given a file name  <code>attachmentbase</code> internally creates a <code>filestream</code> and assigns it the private <code>mimepart part</code> content using <code>mimepart.setcontent(stream)</code>. when creating an <code>attachmentbase</code> using the constructor that takes a <code>stream</code>  it directly assigns the underlying content to this <code>stream</code>.    when the <code>attachmentbase</code> is <a href= https://referencesource.microsoft.com/#system/net/system/net/mail/attachment.cs 546805343337df9b references  rel= nofollow noreferrer >disposed</a>  it internally disposes of the <code>mimepart</code>  which internally disposes of the <code>stream</code> content. if the constructor taking a <code>stream</code> was used  this <code>mimepart</code> class just disposed of a <code>stream</code> it did not create! this bug is a side effect. disposing of objects that a class/method doesn t own makes it impossible to reuse that object later. when creating a disposable object  that object should be able to be disposed before it is garbage collected. this allows it to free up resources like file handles captured by <code>filestreams</code>.    suppose you need to send out a lot of emails  and each email has one image. the image is very large  and all the emails use this same exact image. you should be able to read this file into a <code>memorystream</code>  and reuse this <code>stream</code> for the <code>linkedresource</code> in each email. this would allow little disk read and low memory usage. <code>dispose()</code> is invoked on each message and its resources to free up any handles and unmanaged memory once the message is sent. (again  if it implements <code>idisposable</code>  it should be able to be disposed as soon as it s no longer needed. the code that called <code>dispose()</code> should always be the same code that created the object.) because this <code>dispose()</code> method is not implemented correctly  it just disposed the underlying <code>stream</code> to the image that it did not create. when subsequent messages try to use this <code>stream</code>  they will throw an <code>objectdisposedexception</code>.    a temporary workaround for this bug is to copy the <code>memorystream</code> for each message  and use the copied <code>streams</code>. this still results in little disk read  but now the large image is copied a bunch of times in memory.    this could have all been avoided by following correct patterns and practices and allowing the code that created the <code>stream</code> to be the one to dispose of it  and not assuming it would only be used once. here is a fix for this bug. the code should replace the similar methods. this allows <code>mimepart</code> to be backward compatible. the change to <code>attachmentbase</code> may be a breaking change for code that passes in a <code>stream</code>. the fix is to handle the <code>stream</code> you pass in by disposing of it yourself properly.   <pre><code>public abstract class attachmentbase : idisposable {     mimepart part;      protected attachmentbase(stream contentstream)     {         part.setcontent(contentstream  true);     }      protected attachmentbase(stream contentstream  string mediatype)     {         part.setcontent(contentstream  null  mediatype  true);     }      internal attachmentbase(stream contentstream  string name  string mediatype)     {         part.setcontent(contentstream  name  mediatype  true);     }      protected attachmentbase(stream contentstream  contenttype contenttype)     {         part.setcontent(contentstream  contenttype  true);     } }  internal class mimepart : mimebasepart  idisposable {     private bool _keepopen;      internal void setcontent(stream stream  bool keepopen = false)     {         if (stream == null)         {             throw new argumentnullexception( stream );         }          if (streamset &amp;&amp; !_keepopen)         {             this.stream.dispose();         }          this.stream = stream;         streamset = true;         streamusedonce = false;         transferencoding = transferencoding.base64;         _keepopen = keepopen;     }      internal void setcontent(stream stream  string name  string mimetype  bool keepopen = false)     {         if (stream == null)         {             throw new argumentnullexception( stream );         }          if (!string.isnullorempty(mimetype))         {             contenttype = new contenttype(mimetype);         }          if (!string.isnullorempty(name))         {             contenttype.name = name;         }          setcontent(stream  keepopen);     }      internal void setcontent(stream stream  contenttype contenttype  bool keepopen = false)     {         if (stream == null)         {             throw new argumentnullexception( stream );         }          this.contenttype = contenttype;         setcontent(stream  keepopen);     }      public void dispose()     {         if (stream != null &amp;&amp; !_keepopen)         {             stream.dispose();         }     } } </code></pre>,.net

split a .net code file  this is my first stack overflow quesiton  so if i m not posting correctly  or not tagging right or whatever  please let me know.    for those curious  at the end of this question is a bit of background of why i want to do this.      i m hoping someone has some ideas of how i can easily take a code file and then get an array of strings with each array element containing the contents of a single method from that code file.    what i want to do is be able to easily parse a .net code file into it s indivdial methods.  reading the file from disk is quite simple - parsing so that i have individual strings of each of the methods is what i m looking for a better method of doing.  the code files i will be passing through this are vb  but ideally i d like to see this working with c# also.  for the vb side  cycling through each line looking for the keywords of method declaration  then the next instance of the  end sub  and  end function  should work  but that won t easily translate to c#.  i also can t get past this feeling there has to be a better way - possibly through reflection.      now for the background:  i have recently found that when windows forms are called with .showdialog  the resources aren t cleaned up after your done with the form - you have to specifically dispose of it.  this was discovered tracing down memory leaks in an application i work on.  so what i need is to track down every instance of where showdialog is called and dispose is not called.  a code search shows that i have over 300 instances of showdialog.  that s a bit tedious to go through each one  and find if the form is correctly disposed.  if i have strings of all of the methods  i can just search for methods that include showdialog and not dispose.  this will give me very targeted direction to get these things cleaned up  as well as give me a tool i can run regularly and find anyplace that may have introduced this back into the code.    sorry for the long winded post here.  any and all suggestions are greatly appreciated.,.net

how do i do something to each element in a list   i am currently making a bingo game that calls a number when enter is pressed. it does this until the player s bingo card is empty.     i can not get it so that it calls the first number in the list of numbers and goes on to the second then the third and so on without making a script for each of the 99 numbers.    what i want to do is get the program to find the first element of <code>nums</code> and then get the program to print the string and if the string is in the <code>player_1</code> list then remove the string from <code>player_1</code> and keep on doing the process until either the program has gone through all the strings or the <code>player_1</code> list has no strings left in the list.    here is my code:   <pre><code>import random  def player_1_card():    print(player_1[1:4])    print(player_1[5:8])    print(player_1[9:12])    print(player_1[13:16]) return  nums = [ 01    02    03    04    05    06    07    08    09    10    11    12    13    14    15    16    17    18    19    20    21    22    23    24    25    26    27    28    29    30    31    32    33    34    35    36    37    38    39    40    41    42    43    44    45    46    47    48    49    50    51    52    53    54    55    56    57    58    59    60    61    62    63    64    65    66    67    68    69    70    71    72    73    74    75    76    77    78    79    80    81    82    83    84    85    86    87    88    89    90    91    92    93    94    95    96    97    98    99 ]  random.shuffle(nums) player_1 = random.sample((nums)  16)  while len(player_1) != 0:         input( press &lt;enter&gt; to call a number )         for i in nums:             print( your current bingo card: )             player_1_card()             print( number called is   # )             input( press &lt;enter&gt; to call a number )             if nums(#) in player_1:                 nums.remove(#) </code></pre>   i have placed hashes where i need some help with the code.    i am using python 3.5.2.,python

designing a joint function  i have three functions  that each one of them calls internally the one below it:   <ul> <li>getbitrateoverhttp</li> <li>getfilesizeoverhttp</li> <li>is_serversupporthttprange</li> </ul>   each function uses an http request on it s own. which means the last function uses only a single http request  while the first uses three.    the <code>getbitrateoverhttp</code> function returns only the bitrate.    these functions work fine on their own  but now i want to get all the three outputs for a specific url.    i thought about:   <ol> <li>calling all the functions. the problem is that i ll make 6 http requests instead of 3.</li> <li>changing the definition of the functions to return others vars as well - but then it doesn t serve the basic purpose of the function - to return what it s meant to return. </li> <li>definite another function that doesn t use these definitions  but it doesn t seem smart to define again something that has been already coded.</li> </ol>   any help,python

python extract values of varying length from text files  i would like to load the contents of a .txt file as a string and extract a specific piece of information.  the information  which has lots of text before and after it s occurence  looks like this:   <pre><code>valuename:     1234 </code></pre>   but could also look like:   <pre><code>valuename:     123456 </code></pre>   that is to say  the value is always a string of integers  but of varying length.    i would like to find the  valuename  in the string  and return characters starting 6 characters afterwards.  my thought is to say check and see if the 10 characters starting 6 characters after the  valuename  are integers  and return them in order if they are.  is this possible   thanks kindly.,python
python create decorator preserving function arguments  i m trying to write a decorator that preserves the arguments of the functions it decorates. the motivation for doing this is to write a decorator that interacts nicely with <code>pytest.fixtures</code>.    suppose we have a function <code>foo</code>. it takes a single argument <code>a</code>.   <pre><code>def foo(a):     pass </code></pre>   if we get the argument spec of foo   <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; inspect.getargspec(foo) argspec(args=[ a ]  varargs=none  keywords=none  defaults=none) </code></pre>   we frequently want to create a decorator where the <code>wrapper</code> function passes all of its arguments verbatim to the <code>wrapped</code> function. the most obvious way to do this using <code>*args</code> and <code>**kwargs</code>  though  produces a function with a different argument spec.   <pre><code>def identity_decorator(wrapped):     def wrapper(*args  **kwargs):         return wrapped(*args  **kwargs)     return wrapper      def identity_decorator(wrapped):     def wrapper(*args  **kwargs):         return wrapped(*args  **kwargs)     return wrapper  @identity_decorator def foo(a):     pass </code></pre>   this  not surprisingly  produces a function with an argument spec reflecting the <code>*args</code> and <code>**kwargs</code>.   <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; inspect.getargspec(foo) argspec(args=[]  varargs= args   keywords= kwargs   defaults=none) </code></pre>   is there a way to either change the argument spec to match the wrapped function or create the function with the right argument spec initially,python

python: submitting different jobs to different cpus  i have a fortran <code>atoms.out</code> file that performs some function. i am calling that fortran file from within python with:   <pre><code>values = subprocess.popen([ ./atoms.out    ./%s.klj  % test1   ./%s.out  % test1]  stdout = subprocess.pipe) </code></pre>   i ve looked at <a href= http://www.parallelpython.com/content/view/15/30/  rel= nofollow >python pp</a>  but i dont think it is what i am looking for  as it uses n number of cpus for a single job.    the calculations conducted by the fortran file are not independent and cannot be used with <code>python pp</code>    so my question is how can i submit a number of jobs to a number of different cpus  say for example i have: 7 files that i want to be run over 4 cpus.    so each job is distributed as:   <pre><code>file1 -&gt; cpu1 file2 -&gt; cpu2 file3 -&gt; cpu3 file4 -&gt; cpu4 </code></pre>   then when a job has finished on a cpu it is replaces with the remaining 3 files to run. say <code>file1</code> is finished on <code>cpu1</code> it is replaced by <code>file5</code>  so the distribution of jobs would look like:   <pre><code>file5 -&gt; cpu1 file2 -&gt; cpu2 file3 -&gt; cpu3 file4 -&gt; cpu4 </code></pre>   and so forth until it has finished running the fortran file on the 7 files.,python

printing text in form of circle  i m trying to form figures of the text a person chooses.  i already made a square  pyramid and a parallelogram.     where i get stuck is when i m trying to make a circle. my thought was to use a <code>for i in range (1  height/2)</code> where it would print the text (f.e. --) * i times. then i wanted another for loop to print the exact opposite  so from <code>height/2</code> to <code>height</code>  it should first print <code>height/2*</code> text en for every time the for loop starts again  it should print the text one time less.    i m not completely sure if this will look like a circle somehow.  i ll give my code for a pyramid and a circle. i m aware that for the circle  i still need to do something with <code>   </code>  but as i don t really know how to get everything working in the first place  i haven t began thinking about how i m gonna need blank spaces in that code.   <pre><code>def print_pyramid(height):     text = raw_input( please give in what your pyramid needs to be formed from  you can choose two **  two --  or two letters )     for i in range(1 height+1):          print (height-i+1)*     text * i  def print_circle(height):     text = raw_input( give in what your circle is made of: **  -- or two letters. )     for i in range(1 height/2):         print text*i     for j in range ((height/2)-1 (height/2)+1):         print text*j     for h in range((height/2)+2  height+1):         print text*((height/2)-h) </code></pre>   <a href= http://i.stack.imgur.com/bqif8.jpg  rel= nofollow >example of output  see link</a>,python
open file for random write without truncating   in python  there are a few flags you can supply when opening a file for operation. i am a bit baffled at finding a combination that allow me to do <strong>random write without truncating</strong>. the behavior i am looking for is equivalent to c: create it if it doesn t exist  otherwise  open for write (not truncating)    <code>open(filename  o_wronly|o_creat)</code>    python s <a href= https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/io.html#module-io >document</a> is confusing (to me): <code> w </code> will truncate the file first  <code> + </code> is supposed to mean updating  but <code> w+ </code> will truncate it anyway. is there anyway to achieve this without resorting to the low-level <code>os.open()</code> interface     note: the <code> a </code> or <code> a+ </code> doesn t work either (please correct if i am doing something wrong here)   <pre><code>cat test.txt eee  with open( test.txt    a+ ) as f:   f.seek(0)   f.write( a ) cat test.txt eeea </code></pre>   is that so the append mode insist on writing to the end,python

convert a graph represented by a string of key-value pairs  to a dictionary. python  given a map  represented by a string of double digit numbers separated by commas e.g  12 23 34 45 56 67 78 81  where each pair of digits represents a path between the two digits  convert the string into a graph represented by a dictionary with keys as origins(digits) and values as available destinations from key. e.g 1:[2 8]  2[3] etc. this is my very ugly attempt:   <pre><code>def path(way): x = way.split(   ) y = sorted(set(tele.replace(      ))) graph = dict() for i in x:     for j in range(len(i)):         for h in y:             if h in i and i[j] != h:                 if h in graph:                     graph[h].append((i[j]))                 else:                     graph[h] = [(i[j])] return graph </code></pre>   i intend on implementing the breadth-first search algorithm after this in order to find the best path. i m sorry if my explanation is unclear. any help would be very appreciated  thanks!,python
how to implement server & multi-clients  communication    what i aim to do is to fulfill a mutual communication between one server but multiple clients. here is the server part i wrote:   <pre><code>import subprocess  time  socket  fileinput s = socket.socket(socket.af_inet  socket.sock_stream) host=   port = 2000 s.bind((host  port)) s.listen(2) # here 2 means the maximum number of clients that can connect to the server is 2 conn addr = s.accept() for data in fileinput.input( some file i previously created )     conn.send(data) conn.close() </code></pre>   so  here pretty much is the client-server communication. (only the server part). the question is: this script can implement communication between one client and one server.     how to fulfill communication between one server and multiple clients. let s say i have 6 numbers in the file. i wish to transmit the first 3 to client-a  the 4th to client-b and the rest to client-c.    how to make this happen     i appreciate your precious and experienced skills.,python

pounds to kilograms and grams conversion python function  i need to create a python function named poundstometric which converts weights given in pounds to kilograms and grams.    for example rather than print out 2.2 kilograms the correct answer would be 2 kilograms and 200 grams    to aid your work the following conversions hold:    1 pound = 2.2 kilograms 1 kilogram = 1000 grams    your program should prompt the user for the number of pounds and output the results in kilograms and grams.   <pre><code>def poundstometricfunction(kilograms  grams): pounds = float(input( enter the amount of pounds:   )                kilograms = pounds * 2.2                grams = kilograms * 1000                 print( the amount of pounds you entered is    pounds                         this is    kilograms    kilograms     and   grams                        grams  ) </code></pre>   i know this isn t correct but i m trying to figure out what i m doing wrong i mean i know its probably all wrong but i m new to this and i guess i just need some feedback on what i could add or if i have the correct information what format do i use for the correct syntax.,python

importing module in another module  my question is simple. if i import  let s say  numpy in a module called foo.py  and i imported foo.py in a script that has numpy imported  would numpy be imported twice  in other words  would a module be imported twice in the same script  i care because importing scipy (for example) multiple times (if it s true) is memory inefficient.,python

sorting based on a variable number of sort keys input after execution  i am very new to python and my apologies is this has already been answered.  i can see a lot of previous answers to  sort  questions but my problem seems a little different from these questions and answers.    i have a list of keys  with each key contained in a tuple  that i am trying to sort.  each key is derived from a subset of the columns in a csv file  but this subset is determined by the user at runtime and can t be hard coded as it will vary from execution to execution.  i also have a datetime value that will always form part of the key as the last item in the tuple (so there will be at least one item to sort on - even if the user provides no additional items).    the tuples to be sorted look like:   <pre><code>(col0  col1  .... coln  datetime) </code></pre>   where col0 to coln are based on the values found in columns in a csv file  and the  n  can change from run to run.      in each execution  the tuples in the list will always have the same number of items in each tuple.  however  they need to be able to vary from run to run based on user input.    the sort looks like:    <pre><code>sorted(concurrencydict.keys()  key=itemgetter(0  1  2)) </code></pre>   ... when i do hard-code the sort based on the first three columns.  the issue is that i don t know in advance of execution that 3 items will need to be sorted - it may be 1  2  3 or more.      i hope this description makes sense.    i haven t been able to think of how i can get itemgetter to accept a variable number of values.    does anyone know whether there is an elegant way of performing a sort based on a variable number of items in python where the number of sort items is determined at run time (and not based on fixed column numbers or attribute names),python

i change python code  but python doesn t seem to read the changes  so  i ve been programming in python and i ve run into this really annoying issue.  i wrote a small matrix library and started using it in another module (eg  import matrixlib).  i d find a bug  fix it and run the program again.  bug still there.      i d throw in a few print statements to see what s going on  but they wouldn t print.  i eventually figured out that my changes weren t registering with python.  so i started deleting .pyc files (precompiled python) but that didn t help.      i eventually gave up and just started programming straight from the matrix lib file  but now that issue has come back.  i threw in a print statement to figure out what was going on with a method  fixed the issue  and took it out.  but it still prints.  i even did a search for  print  in a different text editor than idle  but found only not a single print statement in the code.      this isn t really a code issue per say  i ve probably mucked up my python install somehow.  (this only happens on my windows box  not my linux box).  if you want to see the code anyway  feel free.  the hiesenbug-print statement is commented out in my code  yet still executes.   <pre><code>    def det(self):         #had better be a square matrix.         if self.colcount() != self.rowcount():             return none         #are we a 1x1 matrix          if self.colcount() == self.rowcount() == 1:             return self.a[0][0]         #are we a 2x2 matrix          if self.colcount() == self.rowcount() == 2:             return self.a[0][0]*self.a[1][1]-self.a[1][0]*self.a[0][1]         #not a 2x2... so lets start recursing.         d = 0         for e in range(0 self.colcount()):             tmp = partition(self.a  0  e)             if e%2 == 0:                 d = d + self.a[0][e]*self.detrecursive(tmp)             else:                 d = d - self.a[0][e]*self.detrecursive(tmp)         #print d         return d      def detrecursive(self  matrix):         m = matrix()         m.setmatrix(matrix)          return m.det()      def partition(a  r  c):         out = []         for row in range(0  len(a)):             if r != row:                 out.append([])                 for col in range(0  len(a[0])):                     if col != c:                         out[-1].append(a[row][col])         return out </code></pre>,python

python time function inconsistency  i ve been gave an assignment were i had to create two small functions that gives  with equal chance   heads  or  tails  and  similary with a 6 faces thrown dice  1 2 3 4 5 or 6.    important: i could not use randint or similar functions for this assignment.    so i ve created those two functions that generate a  pseudo-random number  utilizing time (first digit of the milliseconds) function from python library:   <pre><code>import time  def dice():     ctrl = false     while ctrl == false:             m = lambda: int(round(time.time() * 1000))             f = m()             d = abs(f) % 10             if d in range(1 7):                     return d                     ctrl = true   def coin():         m = lambda: int(round(time.time() * 1000))         f = m()         if f % 2 == 0:                 return  tails          elif f == 0:                 return  tails          else:                 return  heads  (edit: i don t know why i typed  dimes  before) </code></pre>   however i ve observed a tendency to give  tails  over  heads   so i ve created an function to test the percentage of  tails  and  heads  in 100 throws:   <pre><code>def _test():     ta = 0     he = 0     x = 100     while x &gt; 0:         c = coin()         if c ==  tails :             ta += 1         else:             he += 1     x -= 1     time.sleep(0.001) print( tails:%s heads:%s  % (ta  he)) </code></pre>   the result of the test was (for several times):   <pre><code>tails:56 heads:44 </code></pre>   so i did the same thing with the dice function and the result was:   <pre><code>1:20 2:20 3:10 4:20 5:10 6:20 </code></pre>   so  as you can see  for some reason i could not infer - if it is by some mistake of my or some other reason - the time function has a tendency to give less  3  and  5   and running the test again with all the numbers (zeros  sevens  eights and nines included) i ve come to see that this tendency extends to  0  and  7 .    i would be grateful for some insight and opinions on the matter.    edit:    remove the round() function from the <code>m = lambda: int(round(time.time() * 1000))</code> function solved the problem - as answered by makoto.,python
send a variable from outside the python console or stop a script from outside  i wrote a python script that executes an optimization and runs days to get a solution (due to the costly objective function). in all days work it will be sufficient to just stop the calculation at some point because the solution is good enough for me (but not for the optimization algorithm).    the problem is  i can always abort hitting ctrl+c. but then there is no chance to nicely output the current best parameters  plot the data  save it etc. it would be great to stop the script in a controlled way after the next calculation of the objective function. so my thought was so question some variable (if user_stop=true) and programatically stop the optimization. but how to set such a variable  the python console is blocked during execution.    i thought about setting the content of a text file and reading it in each iteration but it s more than poor and hard to explain for other users of the script. theoretically  i could also ask the user for an input but than the script won t run automatically (which it should until someone decides to stop).    any ideas for my problem     basically that s it - stop the loop at some point but execute the print:   <pre><code>a = 0 while true:     a = a + 1 print(a) </code></pre>,python
reading file and creating dictionary based on delimiters  i have a file that has several lines consisting of items. the structure is a class  followed by a category  followed by prerequisites in the class.   <pre><code>#class  category  pre-requisites(amount of them can change)  math 2430  preprofessional  math 2429|math 2428  math 2431  professional  math 2430|math 2429|math 2428  </code></pre>   what i want to end up having is a dictionary with the class as a key  then the category and prerequisites as the values in a list. something like    <pre><code>{ math 2430  : [ preprofessional    math 2429   math 2428 ]...... } </code></pre>   the vertical bar is an indicator of oncoming prerequisite classes.the problem im running into is that the number or vertical bar delimiters may vary so the pre prequisite classes may vary by line. so im not sure how to split based on how many vertical bars there are   <pre><code>i wrote  zdic = {} pre_req = file.count( | ) # to count how many vertical bars appear if  |  in file : prereq = pre_req for line in file :     course  category  prereq1(depending on bars...) = split( \w+  file) </code></pre>   how do i deal with the fact that the number of pre requisite classes may vary  and depending on how many there are  split accordingly to manipulate and enter into a dixtionary,python

how to take specific letters off a string  i am having difficulty creating a function that removes letters of  t  in two different ways. the <code>parameter</code> is a <code>boolean</code>  if the parameter is <code>true</code> then it will print out a userinput (that is written in my code below) and it will keep asking that same input until the person types in  quit  and when the user does type in  quit  then it will take off all lower case  t  inside the string. if the <code>boolean</code> is <code>false</code>  then the same process applies but instead of it taking out a lower case  t  it will take off a capital  t . also  i want to keep the same type of format i written in my code below  thanks. btw i am using python 2.4.   <blockquote> <pre><code>def removet(boolea):     userinput=str(input( enter a word/sentence you want to process:  ))     while userinput:         string = (raw_input( enter a word/sentence you want to process: ))         if boolea == false:             userinput = userinput + string             while  t  in userinput:                 index = userinput.find( t )                 userinput = userinput[:index] + userinput[index+1:]         if string ==  quit :             keepasking = false             return userinput          else:             userinput = userinput + string             while  t  in userinput:                 index = userinput.find( t )                 userinput = userinput[:index] + userinput[index+1:]             while  t  in userinput:                 index = userinput.find( t )                 userinput = userinput[:index] + userinput[index+1:] </code></pre> </blockquote>,python
how do i override imbedded function/definition values in python  i apologize in advance if the terminology in my question is incorrect. i want to find out if it s possible to override a variable that is hidden deep in a bunch of consecutive class calls that you don t have direct access too  but would still effect the outcome.    here is an example i ve tried to write that will hopefully make my question more clear.    i have 3 python modules  test1.py  test2.py and test3.py. each module has a class and some definitions. test2.py is where the code is run from.    test1.py   <pre><code>class a(object):     def __init__(self  value=5):         self.a = value     def foo(self  value3 = 7  value4 = 5):         from test3 import d         c = self.a + value3 + value4         d = d()         e = d.b()         f = c + e         return f  class b(object):     def __init__(self  value = 1):         self.d = value         object1 = a(self.d)         self.fooreturn = object1.foo()     def bar(self  value2 = 3):         f = value2         g = self.fooreturn + self.d + f         return g </code></pre>   test3.py   <pre><code>class d(object):     def __init__(self  value=6  wanted_value=9):         self.value = value + wanted_value     def a(self  value3 = 4):         self.value3 = value3 * 2         return self.value3     def b(self  value4 = 5):         valuex = self.a()         value5 = value4 + self.value + valuex         return value5 </code></pre>   test2.py   <pre><code>from test1 import b  if __name__ ==  __main__ :     test = b(4)     result = test.bar()     print result </code></pre>   returns a value of:-   <pre><code>55 </code></pre>   i m sorry it looks so convoluted  it s my way of trying to make a value look out of normal reach :)    basically what i would like to do is find out how to redefine the value of  wanted_value  in the test3.py  class d  <strong>init</strong> def  while not changing the  if  in test2.py.   <pre><code>if __name__ ==  __main__ :     test = b(4)     result = test.bar()     print result </code></pre>   one way i can see might be possible would be to redefine the class d definition in test2.py and redirect any call to the original class d to the modified one using a global variable.    e.g.    test2.py   <pre><code>from test1 import b from test3 import d  class dx(d):     # add the value i want to use to  wanted_value      def __init__(self  value=6  wanted_value=3):         self.value = value + wanted_value  # create a global d.__init__ = dx.__init__  if __name__ ==  __main__ :     test = b(4)     result = test.bar()     print result </code></pre>   this errors saying  unbound method_<em>init</em>_() must be called with dx instance as first arguement.    so it s obviously incorrect  but if these is a way to make it work with out having to redefine the whole of class d     any help would be great. it may be obvious that my knowledge of inheritance is not too crash hot :)    thanks.,python
comparing file contents in python  i have two files  say source and target. i compare each element in source to check if it also exists in target. if it does not exist in target  i print it ( the end goal is to have 0 difference). here is the code i have written.   <pre> def finddefaulters(source target):   f = open(source  r )   g = open(target  r )    reference = f.readlines()   done = g.readlines()   for i in reference:     if i not in done:       print i  </pre>   i need help with   <ol> <li>how would this code be rated on a scale of 1-10</li> <li>how can i make it better and optimal if the file sizes are huge.</li> </ol>   another question - when i read all the lines as list elements  they are interpreted as  element\n  - so for correct comparison  i have to add a newline at the end of each file. is there a way to strip the newlines so i do not have to add newline at the end of files. i tried rstrip. but it did not work. thanks in advance.,python
mutable default attribute reset - could someone please guide me through this logic   in <a class= doc-link  href= https://stackoverflow.com/documentation/python/228/functions/930/defining-a-function-with-optional-arguments#t=201607260221064634045 >this entry</a> in the <a class= doc-link  href= https://stackoverflow.com/documentation/python/228/functions#t=201607260221064634045 >functions</a> section of the python documentation  i was confused by the following example:   <pre><code>def append(elem  to=none): if to is none:     to = [] to.append(elem) return to  append(5) # out: [5]     append(3)   # a new list is created # out: [3] </code></pre>   the point here is supposed to be that you are resetting  to  to an empty list at the beginning of every function call to avoid the following:   <pre><code>append(5) # out: [5]     append(3)   # a new list is created # out: [5  3] </code></pre>   but how can you check that  to  is none to set it to []  it seems to me that you are either pulling in the  to  defined in the definition  or you are pulling in the  to  modified by the last call. how does this work,python
what s the difference between hasattr() and  attribute  in dir()   for example:   <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; s =  string  &gt;&gt;&gt; hasattr(s   join ) true &gt;&gt;&gt;  join  in dir(s) true </code></pre>   <a href= http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#hasattr  rel= nofollow >python documentation</a> says that <code>hasattr</code> is implemented calling <code>getattr</code> and seeing whether it raises an exception or not. however  that leads to a great overhead  since the value obtained is discarded and an exception may be raised.    the question is if calling <code> attribute  in dir(obj)</code> means the same thing  is it faster  safe  or may it fail in a particular occasion,python

find the most restrictive data type to which a string can be cast (python)  i want to read text files such as csv  or tab-separated values  but only columns which can be cast to numbers. for instance  if a column contains only strings  i d like not to read it. this is because i d like to avoid working with numpy arrays of multiple data types (i would be interested to know why i should  however questions should not be subject to discussion).    various questions were quite close to mine (see <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3098337/method-for-guessing-type-of-data-represented-currently-represented-as-strings >1</a>  <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/379906/parse-string-to-float-or-int >2</a> and <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/642154/how-to-convert-strings-into-integers-in-python >3</a>). however  apart from <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3098337/method-for-guessing-type-of-data-represented-currently-represented-as-strings >1</a>  they focus on converting the string rather than check which data type it could be converted to  which is why i mostly followed <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3098337/method-for-guessing-type-of-data-represented-currently-represented-as-strings >1</a> to obtain the desired result.    <a href= https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.genfromtxt.html  rel= nofollow noreferrer >numpy s genfromtxt</a> already does something close (by using the  dtype  argument). i suppose i could use this (with  dtype  set to none)  and then just checking each column s data type.    here s what i have so far:   <pre><code>def data_type(string_to_test):     checks to which data type a string can be cast. the main goal is to convert strings to floats. the hierarchy for upcasting goes like this: int-&gt;float-&gt;complex-&gt;string. thus  int is the most restrictive. :param string_to_test: a string of character that hypothetically represents a number :return: the most restrictive data type to which the string could be cast.     # do this to convert also floats that use coma instead of dots: string_to_test = string_to_test.replace(      . ) # first  try to switch from string to int: try:     # this will yield true if string_to_test represents an int  or a float that is equal to an int (e.g.:  1.0 ).     if int(float(string_to_test)) == float(string_to_test):         return int     else:         int(string_to_test)         return float except valueerror:     # if it doesn t work  try switching from string to float:     try:         float(string_to_test)         return float     except valueerror:         # happens with complex numbers and types (e.g.: float(4 + 3j)  or float(float64)).         # if this still doesn t work  try switching from string to complex:         try:             # make sure spaces between operators don t cause any problems (e.g.:  1 + 4j  will not work              # while  1+4j  will).             complex(string_to_test.replace(       ))             return complex         # if none of the above worked  the string is said not to represent any other data types  (remember this         # function is supposed to be used on data that is read from files  so checking only for those types should         #  be exhaustive enough).         except valueerror:             return str </code></pre>   my biggest problem with this is that i find it rather ugly  and also that there could be cases i haven t thought about. thus my question is  could it be done in a better way  .    also  i m interested to know when would it be better to return strings representing that data type  instead of the class itself (e.g.: return  complex  as a string instead of complex  the class). for instance  i know i can use both (the string or the class) when using the method <a href= https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.astype.html  rel= nofollow noreferrer >astype</a> for numpy arrays.    thanks in advance!,python
python- copy folders to another location without using disutils  i m iterating through a directory that contains lots of folders.  i want to copy each one of those folders from <code>src</code> to <code>dest</code>.    i have tried using <code>shutil s copytree</code>  but there is an issue involving overriding existing folders.  i see that the solution is to use disutils  but i can t download disutils because my work computer prevents installation of new packages and pip install doesn t appear to be working from work  either.    is there an alternate solution using default packages     here s the code so you can understand what i m working with:   <pre><code>import os from os.path import join  import shutil   def main():      directory =  daily_completed_surveys      for root  dirs  files in os.walk(directory):        for i in dirs:             if  pop  in i:                 src = os.path.join(root  i)                 dest =  c:\allpop                  shutil.copytree(src  dest) </code></pre>   the daily_completed_surveys folder contains a structure like /[somedate]/pop[computerid][somedate]/[zipped files]    i want to get every folder labeled pop and copy them to the destination directory.

properly resolving import errors with directories  my question here is more about the appropriate way to resolve import errors in a way that is considered  pythonically correct   if there is such a term. i thought i had solution to my problem (posted below and updated)  but even that turns out not work.    <strong>context</strong>    i have looked at various responses to this (like <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30456068/how-to-resolve-import-errors-in-python >how to resolve import errors in python </a>) and i think i ve done those things  but i still have the question that i m posting here.    <strong>example</strong>    i have the following structure:   <pre><code>pacumen   rules     __init__.py     pacman_rules.py   pacman.py   game.py </code></pre>   in <code>pacman_rules.py</code> i have a class:   <pre><code>class pacmanrules:     .... </code></pre>   in my <code>pacman.py</code> file  i have the following import statement:   <pre><code>from rules.pacman_rules import pacmanrules </code></pre>   mind you  this was auto-generated by pycharm. so pycharm shows me that it resolves just fine.    however  when i run <code>pacman.py</code> from the command line  i get the following error:   <pre><code>importerror: cannot import name pacmanrules </code></pre>   i have no idea why that s happening in this case  given the lines of code.    in <code>pacman.py</code> i also have this statement:   <pre><code>from game import gamestatedata </code></pre>   that one is working just fine. notice that the class <code>gamestatedata</code> comes from my <code>game.py</code> file. so i m guessing my issue is that i m trying to import from a file in a different directory rather than from a file in the same directory.    <strong>possible solution (update: does not work)</strong>    so then i tried this import instead:   <pre><code>from rules import pacman_rules </code></pre>   that seems to work  but it requires me to change lines like this:   <pre><code>pacmanrules.getlegalactions(self) </code></pre>   to lines like this:   <pre><code>pacman_rules.pacmanrules.getlegalactions(self) </code></pre>   that just feels messy to me and seems to defeat the purpose of importing a class name so i can use it without having to preface it.    but  as it turns out  this doesn t work either. this just gets a different error:   <pre><code>importerror: cannot import name pacman_rules </code></pre>   so that s my question here. most questions seem to revolve around <em>how</em> to fix the issue; as it turns out i don t even have a  fix.     what i m curious about is why the initial approach doesn t work (especially since pycharm generates it) and if my proposed solution is the appropriate way to handle this.,python
access the name of a list in a python print statement  i am running python 3.6 and pandas 0.19.2 and want to access the name of a list as follows:   <pre><code># work on the following two lists for list in [list1  list2]:      # loop through items in each list     for entry in bucket_set:          # do stuff     # let user know i finished working on list x     print( i just finished working on:  +list) </code></pre>   in the first iteration  this should do stuff and then print out:  i just finished working on list1 . however: when i run my code  i get the following error:    <pre><code>typeerror: must be str  not list </code></pre>   this makes perfect sense (a list is not a string after all)  but <strong>is there any way i can get the name of my list as a string ( list1 ) </strong> i know i can use a dict instead (which is what i m doing right now)  but i m interested nonetheless.,python

challenging way of counting entries of a file dynamically  i am facing a strange question  which despite of trying many times  i am not able to find the logic and proper code to the problem.      i have a file in the format below:     <pre><code>aa:bb:cc dd:ee:ff 100  ----------&gt;line1 aa:bb:cc dd:ee:ff 101  ----------&gt;line2 dd:ee:ff aa:bb:cc 230  ----------&gt;line3 dd:ee:ff aa:bb:cc 231  ----------&gt;line4 dd:ee:ff aa:bb:cc 232  ----------&gt;line5 aa:bb:cc dd:ee:ff 102  ----------&gt;line6 aa:bb:cc dd:ee:ff 103  ----------&gt;line7 aa:bb:cc dd:ee:ff 108  ----------&gt;line8 dd:ee:ff aa:bb:cc 233  ----------&gt;line9   gg:hh:ii jj:kk:ll 450  ----------&gt;line10 jj:kk:ll gg:hh:ii 600  ----------&gt;line11 </code></pre>   my program should read the file line by line. in the first line and second line  corresponding column1 and column2 values are equal. third column is the sequence number which is not the same for any two lines.<br> since line1 and line2 are same except  their sequence numbers differ by value of only 1  i should read those two lines first and write their count as 2 to an output file. if we observe  line 6 and line 7 are same as line 1 and line 2  having consecutive sequence numbers  but the line numbers line3  line4  line5 having different column 1 and column 2 entries came in between them. hence lines(1&amp;2) and lines(6&amp;7) should not be grouped all together. so  in the output file  i should get result like 2 3 2 1 1 1 1. and one more thing is  lines 7 and 8 are differed by sequence number more than 1. hence  line 8 should be counted as a separate entry  not together with lines 6 and 7 though lines 6 7 8 has same first two columns.<br> i hope most people understood the question. if not  i will clarify anything on the question.<br> as you can see this is a very complicated problem. i tried using dictionary as that is the only data structure i know  but no logic works. please help me solve this problem.,python

trouble isolating emails when downloading via python script  i have a script that fetches emails from my account  downloads the attachments  creates some html for an email blast program  and then zips them into a nice little archive. this works well when only one email is present in the inbox  however  the script hangs when multiple emails exist. i feel like this is because the section of the script that zips the files is not looping correctly. what i am trying to accomplish is one zip file for each email. 3 emails in the inbox = 3 seperate zip files. i ve done my best to reduce my code for maximum readability while still maintaining the core structure. could anyone point me in the right direction here  thanks!    code:   <pre><code>for emailid in items:     resp  data = m.fetch(emailid   (rfc822) )     email_body = data[0][1]     mail = email.message_from_string(email_body)      for part in mail.walk():         if part.get_content_type() ==  text/plain :             content = part.get_payload()             #do something/define variables from email contents                 if mail.get_content_maintype() !=  multipart :         continue      for part in mail.walk():         if part.get_content_maintype() ==  multipart :             continue          if part.get( content-disposition ) is none:             continue          filename = part.get_filename()         counter = 1          if not filename:             filename =  part-%03d%s  % (counter   bin )             counter += 1          att_path = os.path.join(detach_dir  filename)          if not os.path.isfile(att_path) :             fp = open(att_path   wb )             fp.write(part.get_payload(decode=true))             fp.close()      path =  c:\directory      os.chdir(path)     for file in os.listdir( . ):         #download attachments     htmlfile = str(token)+ .html      htmlcode = ( &lt;html&gt;html goes here&lt;/html&gt; )     htmldata = open(os.path.join( c:\directory   htmlfile)   w+ )     htmldata.write(htmlcode)     print htmlfile+  complete      htmldata.close()     allfiles = [f for f in os.listdir( . )]     for file in allfiles:         archive = zipfile.zipfile(token+ .zip   mode= a )         archive.write(file)         archive.close()         os.unlink(file) </code></pre>   <strong>update</strong>    here is alink to the complete code. <a href= http://ideone.com/wexv9p  rel= nofollow >http://ideone.com/wexv9p</a>,python

function to print name of passed variable  my initial goal was to create a function which will print the type and memory address of the given object. to be as most universal as possible i wanted also include the variable name  something like this:   <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a=10 &gt;&gt;&gt; print type_addr(a) a: int  0x13b8080 </code></pre>   for this purpose i need to know the name of an variable passed to this function. this <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2553354/how-to-get-a-variable-name-as-a-string-in-python >page</a> suggest following code (it a little bit modified version but the idea remain the same  iterate over <code>locals().iteritems()</code>. i know it is not safe and it has several pitfalls mentioned on given link but my plans was to improve it):   <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python  a = b = c = 10 b = 11  for k  v in list(locals().iteritems()):   if v is b:   # if id(v) == id(b):     print  k: %s  % k     print  v: %s  % v     print  a: %s  % hex(id(k)) </code></pre>   output of above code is:   <pre><code>k: b v: 11 a: 0x7fece0f305f8 </code></pre>   my next goal was to make subroutine which will give me desired result  so i ve tried to wrap it into subroutine:   <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python  a = b = c = 10 b = 11  def addr_type(obj):   for k  v in list(locals().iteritems()):     # if id(v) == id(a):     if v is obj:       print  k: %s  % k       print  v: %s  % v       print  a: %s  % hex(id(k))  for k  v in list(locals().iteritems()):   if v is b:   # if id(v) == id(b):     print  k: %s  % k     print  v: %s  % v     print  a: %s  % hex(id(k))  print  #################   addr_type(b) </code></pre>   the output of above code is:   <pre><code>k: b v: 11 a: 0x7fc9253715f8 ################# k: obj v: 11 a: 0x7fc9253198a0 </code></pre>   as you can see  neither the name of variable nor the address are the same. then i started to dig deeper and tried following:   <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python a = b = c = 10 b = 11  for k  v in list(locals().iteritems()):    print  k: %s  % k    print  v: %s  % v    print  a: %s  % hex(id(k))    print  ##############    if a is b:     print  a and b is the same objects  else:     print  a and b is not the same objects    if a is c:     print  a and c is the same objects  else:     print  a and c is not the same objects    if b is c:     print  b and c is the same objects  else:     print  b and c is not the same objects  </code></pre>   which returned:   <pre><code>k: a v: 10 a: 0x7ff07d54b5d0 ############## k: c v: 10 a: 0x7ff07d54bbe8 ############## k: b v: 11 a: 0x7ff07d54b5f8 ############## &lt;some loaded modules here but nothing interesting&gt; ############## a and b is not the same objects a and c is the same objects b and c is not the same objects </code></pre>   questions:   <ol> <li>how to rewrite the working code and make the function that will print the name of passed variable </li> <li>why the same objects have different addresses </li> </ol>,python

python programming string handling  for an expression with parentheses  we can define the nesting depth as the maximum number of parentheses that are open when reading the expression from left to right. for instance  the nesting depth of  (33+77)(44-12)  is 1  while the nesting depth of  (a(b+c)-d)(e+f)  is 2.    write a python function depth(s) that takes a string containing an expression with parentheses and returns an integer  the nesting depth of s. you can assume that s is well-parenthesized: that is  that is  every  (  has a matching  )  after it and every  )  has a matching  (  before it.    here are some examples to show how your function should work.   <pre><code>depth( 22 ) 0 depth( (a+b)(a-b) ) 1 depth( (a(b+c)-d)(e+f) ) 2 </code></pre>   this is what i tried   <pre><code>def depth(s):     count i=0 0;     while i&lt;=len(s):         if s[i]== ( :             count=count+1;         if s[i]== ) :             return count         i=i+1;     return count      #this is what i tried. </code></pre>,python

why is the python index function execution time faster than my own linear search function   i m doing an experiment comparing the execution time of the index function and my own linear search function. to my understanding  python implements a linear search algorithm for the index function so the execution time should be roughly the same  shouldn t it     my own search function looks like this   <pre><code>def linearsearch (x numlist length):           n = 0     for i in range(length):             n = n + 1             if numlist[i] == x:                     return i  n     return -1  n </code></pre>,python
python get all intermediate values from a transition  is there away to transition between 2 values in python  something like:     transition(1 15)    this will run a loop returning all intermediate values (1 2 3 4 5....). sorry for the very basic question..,python
python - sending multiple values for one argument to a function  i am a few days new to python so if this is silly please excuse me..    is there a method to sending multiple variables to a single function  as an example:   <pre><code>pe.plot_chart(conn 7760  datasource1  123 save=true) </code></pre>   this above function takes a connection to sql where it pulls data for unique id 7760 from datasource1 (uniqueid 123). can i use some method to send multiple criteria for the datasource1 field  e.g.   <pre><code>pe.plot_chart(conn 7760 [ datasource1   datasource2 ] [123 345] save=true) </code></pre>   pe.plot_chart was created by me  so any modifications that have to be made to it to make it work are fine    is this type of operation possible to perform     edit: adding on some extra info.    the plot_chart function.. well it plots a chart  and saves it to the location above. each call of the function produces one graph  i was hoping that by sending multiple values for a parameter i could have the function dynamically add more series to the plot.    so if i send 4 data sources to the function  i will end up with 4 lines on the plot. for this reason i am not sure looping through a data source collection would be good (will just produce 4 plots with one line ),python
how to return stdout of a python function at regular intervals   i m calling several functions from one main function mainfunc (which is exposed as restful service using flask module). execution may take few minutes to an hour to complete and requirement is to display progress (output of functions being called) every 30 seconds. as rest api calls are made from another program to mainfunc() so it should return the output (i.e current status) at each call.    i tried yield and stringio as per <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16571150/how-to-capture-stdout-output-from-a-python-function-call >how to capture stdout output from a python function call </a> but could not make it work  stdout is returned only on completion of all tasks and not in between. please suggest if this can be done.   <pre><code>mainfunc():     runs_for_5_mins()     runs_for_30_mins()       ...     return output </code></pre>,python
extending base classes in python  i m trying to extend some  base  classes in python:   <pre><code>class xlist (list):     def len(self):         return len(self)      def add(self  *args):         self.extend(args)         return none   class xint (int):     def add(self  value):         self += value         return self   x = xlist([1 2 3]) print x.len()   ## &gt;&gt;&gt; 3 ok print x         ## &gt;&gt;&gt; [1 2 3] ok x.add (4  5  6) print x         ## &gt;&gt;&gt; [1 2 3 4 5 6] ok  x = xint(10) print x         ## &gt;&gt;&gt; 10 ok x.add (2) print x         ## &gt;&gt;&gt; 10  # not ok (#1)  print type(x)         ## &gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;class  __main__.xint &gt; ok x += 5 print type(x)         ## &gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;type  int &gt;  # not ok (#2) </code></pre>   it works fine in the <em>list</em> case because the <em>append</em> method modifies the object  in place   without returning it. but in the <em>int</em> case  the <em>add</em> method doesn t modify the value of the external <em>x</em> variable. i suppose that s fine in the sense that <em>self</em> is a local variable in the <em>add</em> method of the class  but this is preventing me from modifying the initial value assigned to the instance of the class.    is it possible to extend a class this way or should i define a class property with the base type and map all the needed methods to this property,python

condense this python statement without destroying readability  i m pretty new to python still  so i m trying to figure out how to do this and need some help.    i use return codes to verify that my internal functions return successfully. for example (from internal library functions):   <pre><code>result = some_function(arg1 arg2) if result != ok: return result </code></pre>   or (from main script level):   <pre><code>result = some_function(arg1 arg2) if result != ok: abort_on_error( could not complete  some_function : %s  % messages(result)) </code></pre>   can i get this down to one line without making it unreadable     edit: some people are recognizing that exceptions might be a better choice. i wanted to save exceptions only for very  exceptional  scenario capturing. the return codes may be expected to fail at times  and i thought it was generally bad practice to use exceptions for this scenario.,python

unpacking more than one list as argument for a function  if i have a function like:   <pre><code>def f(a b c d):     print a b c d </code></pre>   then why does this works:   <pre><code>f(1 2 3 4) f(*[1 2 3 4]) </code></pre>   but not this:   <pre><code>f(*[1 2]   *[3 4])     f(*[1 2]   *[3 4])                ^ syntaxerror: invalid syntax </code></pre>        <strong>edit</strong> : for information  the original problem was to replace one of the argument in a function wrapper. i wanted to replace a given member of the inputted *args and tried something like:   <pre><code>def vectorize_pos(f n=0):             decorator  vectorize the processing of the nth argument     :param f: function that dont accept a list as nth argument             def vectorizedfunction(*args **kwargs):         if isinstance(args[n] list):             return map(lambda x : f( *(args[:n])   x   *(args[n+1 :])  **kwargs) args[n])         else:             return f(*args **kwargs)     return vectorizedfunction </code></pre>   that s where the question arose from. and i know there is other way do do the same thing but only wanted to understand why unpacking one sequence worked but not for more.,python
remove a specific phrase from a list of lists  i have stored data in a list of lists (i couldn t use a dict because i need to have duplicate keys). the list is like:   <pre><code>data = [[1   name email@email.com address ]  [2   name2 email@@email2.com address ]  ...] </code></pre>   my goal is to remove the email addresses from the data list (i.e. the list of lists). unfortunately  the email addresses are all different. they only share one common trait: they all contain the symbol  @ .    i tried to use list comprehensions. however  i can only do it so that the entire element gets removed  i.e.  name email@email.com address  gets removed entirely:   <pre><code>newlist = [element for element in data.split() if  @  not in elment] </code></pre>   i thought of splitting  name email@email.com address  into sublists using     as the delimiter. however  that presents a problem as well: it ruins the format. it would be difficult for me to group the lists together to the initial format  because sometimes  name email@email.com address  contains more than three words. for example  it could be   name1 name2 name3 email@email.com email2 email3 address1 address2 address3 .    what is the best way of doing this     edit:    to answer adam smith s question  i m looking for   <pre><code>data = [[1   name address ]  [2   name2 address ]  ...] </code></pre>   as my output. in other words  the original format (list of lists  where the sublists contain two elements  one being the number and the other one being  name  address  address1  etc ) is preserved without the email addresses.,python

how do i repeat a for loop while maintaining values from the previous for loop   i have written a function for gradient descent and am stuck on figuring out how to repeat the for loop  iters  times. x is a 2d array and y is a 2d array. y is the target value and x is the data that corresponds to the target value. i want to iterate through both simultaneously hence the zip() in the for loop  but i also want to be able to repeat iterating through x and y but with the updated coefficients.    i tried wrapping the for loop in a while loop  but i get an error saying that the zip argument #2 must support iteration. i m assuming that what is happening is that once the for loop iterates through the 2 ndarrays  the compiler cannot  reset  and loop through the arrays again. am i correct and how do i fix this     <pre><code>def gradient_descent_lr(x y alpha iters):     x_coef = 0     y_int = 0     coef_list = []      for x  y in zip(x y):         #evaluate func (0 first)         f_eval = (x_coef * x) + y_int         #find error         error = f_eval - y         #update coefficients         y_int = y_int - (alpha*error) #adjust bias coefficient by the error         x_coef = x_coef - (alpha*error*x)         coef_list.append((float(y_int) float(x_coef)))  return coef_list </code></pre>   edit:     nevermind  i figured out that the problem wasn t in iterations  the problem was in having the variable name being y in both the argument and in the for loop. you can close this question.,python

using recursion in python class methods  nb noob alert ...  !    i am trying to use recursion in a python class method  but with limited results.    i m trying to build a car class  with very basic attributes: id  position in a one lane road (represented by an integer)  and velocity. one of the functions i have is used to return which car id is in front on this one -- i.e. if we have class:   <pre><code>class car:     def __init__(self  position  id  velocity):         self.position = position         self.id = id         self.velocity = velocity </code></pre>   now  i ve come up with the following class method (additional details below the code):   <pre><code>def findsuccessorcar(self  cars):      successorcar =        smallestgapfound = 20000000       for car in cars:         if car.id == self.id: continue          currentgap = self.calculategap(car)          if (currentgap &gt; -1) and (currentgap &lt; smallestgapfound):             smallestgapfound = currentgap             successorcar = car      if successorcar ==   :         return 1 # calling code checks for 1 as an error code     else:                 return successorcar </code></pre>   the plan is to create car objects  then store them in a list. each time the findsuccessormethod is called  this global list of cars is passed to it  e.g.    <pre><code>    c1 = testcar.car(4  5  1) # position  pos_y  vel  id         c2 = testcar.car(7  9  2)         c3 = testcar.car(9  1  2)         cars = [c1  c2  c3]          c1_succ = c1.findsuccessorcar(cars) </code></pre>   this works fine: the find successor car function will say that car c2 is in front of car c1 (position 7 ahead of position 4).    however  i want car c1 to work out what car is in front of its immediate successor -- that is  which car is in front of the car in front  which in this case is car c3. my thinking was that if i did c1_succ.findsuccessorcars(cars) then this should work fine: doing type(c1_succ) shows it is an instance and hasattr shows that it has the anticipated object attributes.     however  when i do try to execute c1_succ.findsuccessorcars(cars)  an integer is returned. hence  i am confused -- why doesn t this work  why can you not recursively execute a class method in this fashion  where does this integer come from     nb gut feel says that this has something to do with the self declaration  and that i ll need to modify my code so that as well as a global list of cars  there ll need to be a global list of their current positions  or another class method  e.g.  findsuccessorssuccessor (yes  fully aware of crummy naming!). however  i am interested to understand why this recursive approach does not work.     update    here is the requested code for calculating a gap between 2 cars -- i appreciate it is very basic  so not too much laughter at the back please.   <pre><code>    def calculategap(self  car):             calculate the gap between two cars                     thiscar = self         othercar = car          gap = othercar.position_x - thiscar.position_x           return gap </code></pre>,python
how to cancel python schedule  i have a repeated python schedule task as following which need to run getmystock() every 3 minutes in startmonitor():   <pre><code>from stocktrace.util import settings import time  os  sys  sched schedule = sched.scheduler(time.time  time.sleep)  def periodic(scheduler  interval  action  actionargs=()):   scheduler.enter(interval  1  periodic                    (scheduler  interval  action  actionargs))   action(*actionargs)   def startmonitor():         from stocktrace.parse.sinaparser import getmystock             periodic(schedule  settings.polling_interval  getmystock)     schedule.run( ) </code></pre>   the questions are:    1.how could i cancel or stop the schedule when some user event comes     2.is there any other python module for better repeated scheduling just like java quartz,python
comparing a word in a list to a word in a file  i m trying to write a program that loops through a list and checks a file to see if that word is in there. at first  the file is read and then if a word is found  it breaks out of that loop. with the remaining lines in the file after that word is found  i want to compare with the list. the code below isn t working. it just breaks out of the loop and doesn t find the word.  thanks for your assistance.    <pre><code>def readfile(): with open( file.txt    r ) as myfile:     for line in myfile:         if  hello  in line:             break     for word in mylist:         if word in myfile:            print(word +  found ) </code></pre>,python
merged sort algorithm  i have a merge algorithm which is really fast: it s currently set up to check unknown words between lists; this function checks common words  i need to change the function below to check if words are in vocab or wds or neither i don t properly understand the function so any comments about what specific lines do would be great.    def find_unknowns_merge_pattern(vocab  wds):   <pre><code>result = [] xi = 0 yi = 0  while true:     if xi &gt;= len(vocab):         result.extend(wds[yi:])         return result      if yi &gt;= len(wds):         return result      if vocab[xi] == wds[yi]:  # good  word exists in vocab         yi += 1      elif vocab[xi] &lt; wds[yi]: # move past this vocab word          xi += 1      else:                     # got word that is not in vocab         result.append(wds[yi])         yi += 1 </code></pre>   def check(bigger_vocab book_words):   <pre><code>    both = [ ]         for words in bigger_vocab:             for people in book_words:                 if words == people:                     words.split()                     both.append(words)      return both </code></pre>   the problem is it takes at least 5 seconds whereas my merge algorithm takes 0.08. how can i call that function so i can make this one faster,python

variable set to function call returns none  i am making a simple ceaser cipher program in python  and this concept has confused me for quite some time.    what i do is ask for raw_input from users to determine the message and key for the cipher like so:   <pre><code>def user_input():     ask_user = raw_input( do you want to encrypt or decrypt a     message  )     if ask_user in  encrypt e .split():         message = get_message()         key = get_key()         translate_message(message  key)     else:         print  type encrypt or e for encryption  or decrypt or d doe decryption          user_input() </code></pre>   this collects the message and key  and passes into translate_message for the actual encryption.    here is my get_message function:   <pre><code>def get_message():     get_user_message = raw_input( enter in your message\n )     vm = validate_message(get_user_message)     if not vm:         print  please enter a valid message          get_message()     else:         print get_user_message         return get_user_message </code></pre>   i want to validate the input to make sure the user enters the correct values. if the value is incorrect according to validate_message it calls get_message again  else get_message returns the original value.    here s validate_message:   <pre><code>def validate_message(message):     if not re.match(r ^[a-za-z]+$   message):         return false     return true </code></pre>   just a simple check (i like my functions to do one thing)    normally  this runs fine and the key &amp; message values are returned like normal. the problem comes when i intentionally input incorrect values to test my validation.    here s what translate_message returns without incorrect values(it just returns the two values):   <pre><code> test_message   22 </code></pre>   the confusion comes when i input incorrect values. say i enter 3333 (will recall get_message() because of incorrect value)  until the user enters correct input. translate_message returns none if the user enters any kind of incorrect value before successfully entering a value   <pre><code>none  22 </code></pre>   in the get_message() function i add a print statement right before the return value  which prints out the correct value as expected. so why is    key = get_key()    equaling to none  i went through the logic in get_message() and i can t see where the return value is equal to none when it should return the users correct guess.    any help is appreciated  and if there is a better way to implement this type of logic  i d like to know! i m fairly new to python programming.    thanks!,python

zip together each element of one list  start with a list of strings. each string will have the same number of characters  but that number is not predetermined  nor is the unrelated total number of strings.    here is an example:   <pre><code>data = [ abc    efg    ijk    mno ] </code></pre>   my desired final output is something like:   <pre><code>[( a    e    i    m )  ( b    f    j    n )  ( c    g    k    o )] </code></pre>   my desired output is what i am expecting to see after using <code>zip()</code> in some way. my problem is that i cannot find the right way to zip each element of one array together.    essentially  i am trying to get the columns out of a group of rows.    <strong>what i have tried so far:</strong>   <ol> <li> splitting the data into a two dimensional list:     <code>split_data = [list(row) for row in rows]</code> </li> </ol>   which gives me:   <pre><code>[[ a    b    c ]  [ e    f    g ]  [ i    j    k ]  [ m    n    o ]] </code></pre>  <ol start= 2 > <li> trying to use <code>zip()</code> on that with something like:     <code>zip(split_data)</code> </li> </ol>   i continue to end up with this:   <pre><code>[([ a    b    c ] )  ([ e    f    g ] )  ([ i    j    k ] )  ([ m    n    o ] )] </code></pre>   obviously  it is zipping each element with nothing  causing it to return the original data tupled with a blank. how can i get <code>zip()</code> to consider each element of <code>data</code> or <code>split_data</code> as a list that should be zipped     what i need is <code>zip(data[0]  data[1]  data[2]  ...)</code>,python

does the python sys.path act like unix path   let s say i have a local development directory with modules that i m writing  and a system-wide site-packages directory where these modules will eventually be installed. in the case where i m modifying an existing module and i want to test it i would like to be sure that the module i m importing is the one in my local site-packages directory. reading about the <a href= http://docs.python.org/2/library/site.html  rel= nofollow >site</a> module it seems like i can have a file with a <code>.pth</code> suffix where each line in that file will be appended to the <code>sys.path</code> variable. i ve set that up  and i can confirm that my development directory is showing up later in the list  but when i import a module it s importing from the system wide directory.    simplified example:   <pre><code>$ virtualenv test_sys $ cd test_sys $ source bin/activate $ mkdir site_modules $ mkdir user_modules </code></pre>   in each site_modules and user_modules i ve put a directory called <code>test_module</code> with the following in the <code>__init__.py</code>:   <pre><code>import os  print(os.path.abspath(__file__)) </code></pre>   now i ve added a file called <code>site_modules.pth</code> to <code>test_sys/lib/python2.7/site-packages</code>:   <pre><code>/home/chris/test_sys/site_modules /home/chris/test_sys/user_modules </code></pre>   and i expect that when i import test_module from the python interpreter it would print the <code>user_modules</code> directory but it doesn t:   <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import test_module /home/chris/test_sys/site_modules/test_module/__init__.pyc &gt;&gt;&gt; </code></pre>   yes  i ve ensured that <code>user_modules</code> shows up later in <code>sys.path</code> than <code>site_modules</code>.    how can i ensure that a module that exists in multiple directories in <code>sys.path</code> will always be imported from a specific directory,python
status of chained assignment in python  at several occasions i stumbled upon c-style assignment in python such as <code>a = b = 0</code>. by diligent googling i found out that this is called chained assignment: [<a href= http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/assignment_%28computer_science%29#chained_assignment  rel= nofollow noreferrer >1</a>] [<a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11498441/what-is-this-kind-of-assignment-in-python-called-a-b-true >2</a>] [<a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7601823/how-do-chained-assignments-work >3</a>]. however  it appears that this feature is not mentioned in the <a href= http://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#assignment-statements  rel= nofollow noreferrer >official documentation</a>.    does this mean that chained assignment is still in experimental phase  or simply that the official documentation is slightly behind the development,python

in what order should the python concepts be explained to absolute beginners   i am teaching python to undergraduate math majors. i am interested in the optimal order in which students should be introduced to various python concepts. in my view  at each stage the students should be able to solve a non-trivial programming problem using only the tools available at that time. each new tool should enable a simpler solution to a familiar problem. a selection of numerous concepts available in python is essential in order to keep students focused. they should also motivated and should appreciate each newly mastered tool without too much memorization.  here are some specific questions:    <ul> <li>for instance  my predecessor introduced lists before strings. i think the opposite is a better solution. </li> <li>should function definitions be introduced at the very beginning or after mastering basic structured programming ideas  such as decisions (if) and loops (while)  </li> <li>should sets be introduced before dictionaries </li> <li>is it better to introduce reading and writing files early in the course or should one use input and print for most of the course </li> </ul>   any suggestions with explanations are most welcome.    <strong>edit:</strong> in high school the students were introduced to computers. a few of them learned how to program. prior to this they had a course  covering word  excel  powerpoint  html  latex  a taste of mathematica  but no programming. 5 years ago i used mathematica in this course and the follow-up course uses c and later java. now i teach introduction to python and in the follow-up course my colleague teaches object-oriented programming in python. later a student may take special courses on data structures  algorithms  optimization and in some elective courses they learn on their own mathematica  matlab and r.,python

rearrange data using python  so following the question i asked before  (<a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25042042/replacing-special-patterns-in-a-string-reading-from-a-file noredirect=1#comment38981072_25042042 >replacing special patterns in a string  reading from a file</a>) i seemed to resolve the problem there. but now i m pretty much stuck with this problem for a month.     so with the code there   it reads the data from a file  parse it (so it divides the fields with tabs) but now i want the program to recognize the data ( so it needs to recognize in this example the authors  year of publication   isbn) and has to rearrange that data into a specific form/ pattern like for example:   <pre><code>input data: aubrecht  christoph; özceylan  aubrecht dilek; klerx  joachim; freire  sérgio (2013) “future-oriented activities as a concept for improved disaster risk management. disaster advances”  6(12)  1-10.

python immutable object from within function  i asked a previous question on stackoverflow here: <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5653150/python-immutable-types-in-function-calls >python immutable types in function calls</a>     which made it clear that only references to immutable objects are passed to functions  and so passing a tuple to a function does <em>not</em> result in a full memory copy of that object.    however  according to: <a href= http://www.testingreflections.com/node/view/5126  rel= nofollow noreferrer >http://www.testingreflections.com/node/view/5126</a>    <blockquote>     some objects  like strings  tuples    and numbers  are immutable. <em>altering</em>   them inside a function/method will   create a new instance and the original   instance outside the function/method   is not changed.   </blockquote>   i wrote some test code  where an immutable object is passed to a function. as expected  i can modify the object via the parameter-name/reference defined as part of the function header  and all changes only persist within the called function  leaving the original object outside of the function untouched.    so my question is:    is the new instance created <em>only when an attempt is made to alter/modify</em> the object passed in  i m guessing that if the object is not changed  a reference to it is all that is required. <strong>more importantly  if it does create a copy upon attempted modification  how does python manage the memory  with a zero-copy/copy-on-write  or does it create a complete replicated object (with the whole object s size reserved in memory) visible only within the called function </strong>,python

is there an easy way to convert a string containing a string literal into the string it represents   i m trying to (slightly) improve a script that does a quick-and-hacky parse of some config files.    upon recognising  an item  read from the file  i need to try to convert it into a simple python value. the value could be a number or a string.    to convert strings read from the file into python numbers i can just use <code>int</code> or <code>float</code> and catch the <code>valueerror</code> if it wasn t actually a number. is there something similar for python strings  i.e.   <pre><code>s1 =  goodbye world. :(  s2 = repr(s1) s3 =      not a string literal       s4 = s3.strip()  v1 = parse_string_literal(s1) # throws valueerror v2 = parse_string_literal(s2) # returns  goodby world. :(  v3 = parse_string_literal(s3) # throws valueerror v4 = parse_string_literal(s4) # returns  not a string literal  </code></pre>   in the file  string values are represented very similarly to python string literals; they can be quoted with either   or    and could contain backslash escapes  etc. i could roll my own parser with regexes  but if there s something already existing i d rather not re-invent the wheel.    i could use <code>eval</code> of course  but that s always somewhat dangerous.,python
how to use python to fill in dates and values so that every day has the same number of entries   i have a data set that looks like the table below. every day has time stamps with 15 minutes interval  so there should be 15*24 = 96 entries per day. it is important that each day has the same number of values  because the np.corrceof() function i will use later to find the correlation of each day requires this.    <pre><code>date               value 5/1/2015 0:00:00    23 5/1/2015 0:15:00    22 5/1/2015 0:30:00    50 ...... 5/1/2015 23:30:00   60 5/1/2015 23:45:00   27 </code></pre>   however  the problem right now is that some days are missing values. for example  5/2/2016 below only have two entries.    <pre><code>5/2/2015 0:00:00    60 5/2/2015 0:15:00    45 5/3/2015 0:00:00    60   ...... </code></pre>   what i hope to do is to complete the 5/2/2015 time series by adding 94 extra rows (0:30:00  0:45:00  ...23:45:00)  and use 45 (the last value in 5/2/2015) as the duplicate for all the  fake data  created for the rest of this day. i also hope the script can do the same for the other days that are missing values.    i heard about the python interpolation function (scipy.interpolate) but it does not seem to work here      apologize for not showing any coding examples as i have no clues how to do it in a pythonian way. if you could give me a small example of how to solve this problem or just point me to the right function that would be great. thank you for your help in advance!,python

python for loop doesn t have expected results  i got a bit stuck with a for loop - what i can see it is doing appears correct but isn t exactly what i m trying to accomplish with it. i ve come from a c background but any advice here would be beneficial.   <pre><code>def deal(player_num  cards):     a = 0     z = 0     i = 0     b = 0     c = player_num     hand = [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16]         for a in range(player_num):         hand[a] = cards[i] + cards[i+b+c]         b == b+1         i == i+1         z == z+1     return hand  </code></pre>   so the <code>for a in range(player_num)</code> seems to be working (appends <code>a++</code>) but <code>hand[0]</code>  <code>hand[1]</code>  etc. gets the same hand. i guess it loops a but not the other variables  so i need to use more than 1 nested loop to get <code>i++</code>  <code>b++</code> and <code>c++</code>,python

how can i print many significant figures in python   for a scientific application i need to output very precise numbers  so i have to print 15 significant figures. there are already questions on this topic here  but they all concern with <em>truncating</em> the digits  not <em>printing more</em>.    i realized that the <code>print</code> function converts the input <code>float</code> to a 10 character <code>string</code>. also  i became aware of the <code>decimal</code> module  but that does not suit my needs.     so the question is  how can i easily print a variable amount of signifcant figures of my floats  where i need to display more than 10,python

removing uppercase letters from a string in python  i am trying to write a function eliminate that takes a string and 2 optional arguments. the first optional argument (bad_characters) takes a letter and the third argument (case_sensitive) takes a boolean value. the function should take a string s and remove all instances of bad_characters. if case_sensitive is true  then the function should act case sensitive. if false  then it does not need to. this is what i have so far.   <pre><code>def eliminate(s bad_characters = [] case_sensitive = true or false):         takes a string s and returns the string with all bad_characters     removed. if case_sensitive is true  then the function will only     remove uppercase letters if there are uppercase letters in     bad_characters.     string --&gt; string        while true:         if case_sensitive = false:             for character in s:                 if bad_characters == character:                     newlist = s.replace(bad_characters   )                     return newlist         break </code></pre>   i am having a hard time figuring out how to make the function remove upper case letters if needed. the function should also work if bad_characters is a list  tuple  or string.,python

how can i  fix  floating numbers in python by intelligently choosing the correct decimal place to round to   i ve seen many discussions here about rounding floating values in python or similar topics  but i have a related problem that i want a good solution for.    context:    i use the netcdf4 python library to extract data from netcdf files. my organization keeps a precision attribute on variables within these files.    example: <code>ts:data_precision = 0.01f ;</code>    i collect these precision attributes using the library like this:   <pre><code>d = netcdf4.dataset(path) # assume path is the file or url link precisions = {} for v in d.variables:     try:         precisions[v] = d.variables[v].__getattribute__( data_precision )     except attributeerror:         pass return precisions </code></pre>  <hr>   when i retrieve these precision values from a dataset  in python they end up showing up like:   <pre><code>{u lat : 9.9999997e-05  u lon : 9.9999997e-05  u ts : 0.0099999998  u ssps : 0.0099999998} </code></pre>   but  what i really want is:   <pre><code>{u lat : 0.0001  u lon : 0.0001  u ts : 0.01  u ssps : 0.01} </code></pre>  <hr>   essentially i need a way in python to intelligently round these values to their most appropriate decimal place. i am sure i can come up with a really ugly method to do this  but i want to know if there is already a  nice  solution to this problem.    for my use case  i suppose i can take advantage of the fact that since these values are all  data_precision  values  i can just count the zero s from the decimal place  and then round to the last 0. (i m making the assumption that <code>0 &lt; n &lt; 1</code>). with these assumptions  this would be my solution:   <pre><code>#/usr/bin/python  def intelli_round(n):     def get_decimal_place(n):         count = 0         while n &lt; 1:             n *= 10             count += 1         return count     return round(n  get_decimal_place(n))  examples = [0.0099999  0.00000999  0.99999] for e in examples:     print e  intelli_round(e) </code></pre>   .   <pre><code>0.0099999 0.01 9.99e-06 1e-05 0.99999 1.0 </code></pre>   does this seem appropriate  it seems to work under the constraints  but i m curious to see alternatives.,python

importing python modules from a distant directory  what s the shortest way to import a module from a distant  relative directory     we ve been using this code which isn t too bad except your current working directory <em>has</em> to be the same as the directory as this code s or the relative path breaks  which can be error prone and confusing to users.   <pre><code>import sys sys.path.append( ../../../path/to/shared/code ) </code></pre>   this code (i think) fixes that problem but is a lot more to type.   <pre><code>import os sys sys.path.append(os.path.realpath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__)   ../../../path/to/shared/code ))) </code></pre>   is there a shorter way to append the absolute path  the brevity matters because this is going to have to be typed/appear in a lot of our files. (we can t factor it out because then it would be in the shared code and we couldn t get to it. chicken &amp; egg  bootstrapping  etc.)    plus it bothers me that we keep blindly appending to sys.path but that would be even more code. i sure wish something in the standard library could help with this.    this will typically appear in script files which are run from the command line. we re running python 2.6.2.    <strong>edit:</strong> the reason we re using relative paths is that we typically have multiple  independent copies of the codebase on our computers. it s important that each copy of the codebase use its own copy of the shared code. so any solution which supports only a single code base (e.g.   put it in site-packages. ) won t work for us.    any suggestions  thank you!,python

importing modules from packages in python  such a basic issue i guess i can t even find the answer anyhwere  so my first python program  i downloaded the macholib package from pypi  then unzipped it and ran installed the setup.py using python install  now i m trying to run a program where i first import the macholib  then when i try to access methods like macho  it gives me an error saying macholib module has no attributes called macho. my understanding is macholib is a package and not a module or something  hence i cant use the contents of the package. please answer  i ve wasted too much time on such a simple newbie issue. running a mac with the latest version of python.    code:   <pre><code>import sys import macholib macho(divxinstaller.dmg)  </code></pre>   i tried macholib.macho(divxinstaller.dmg) and macholib.macho.macho(divxinstaller.dmg)   <pre><code>error for python test.py  traceback (most recent call last):   file  test.py   line 3  in &lt;module&gt;     macho(divxinstaller.dmg) nameerror: name  macho  is not defined </code></pre>,python

list comprehension squaring odds  this is what i am supposed to do:   <blockquote>    given the variable <code>nums</code>  whose value is a list of integers  write an assignment statement that assigns to the variable <code>square_odds</code> the list of the squares of the odd numbers in the list <code>nums</code>.         you must use list comprehension.  </blockquote>   here is what i have so far  i know the range part is wrong but what is it supposed to look like    <pre><code>nums = [2 ** square_odds for square_odds in range(nums) if square_odds != x%2] </code></pre>   i think there are other places that are wrong but i am not sure.    i changed it to    <pre><code>nums = [square_odds**2 for square_odds in range(100) if square_odds%2 != 0]  </code></pre>   i received the message    wrong: you have not assigned to square_odds.,python

file input and output in python  stripping of space and outputting to list  i am writing a program in python to take 5 lines of input from a file  var_input  and input it into a list  and then input each seperate number into the list first or second     i am just wondering what the best way would be to go about separating the space from in between each number and then appending it to the lists first or second. i am thinking about using python s split method but i am not sure about how to do this    data in input file would look like this   <pre><code>18 24                10 5 101 567 234 90 107 4567 </code></pre>   first should contain <code>[ 18    10    101    234    107 ]</code>    second should contain <code>[ 24    5    567    90    4567 ]</code>          here s what i have so far   <pre><code>first = [] second = []  file_input = open( var_input ) input_list = file_input.readlines() </code></pre>   thank you so much  any help would be greatly appreciated,python
extracting year from date column using panda  so i have a csv containing a bunch of columns  <code>date</code> being one of them  which i m mostly interested in right now. i ve managed to extract the column from the file  but i m not interested in the entire date  only the  year  part of it.   <pre><code>with open( /users/thomasjn/documents/sfpd_incidents.csv    r ) as f:     data = pd.read_csv(f)      dates = data[ date ].str.split( / ) </code></pre>   this is what i ve done so far  which gives me a result like this:   <pre><code>0          [01  19  2015 12:00:00 am] 1          [02  01  2015 12:00:00 am] 2          [02  01  2015 12:00:00 am] 3          [02  01  2015 12:00:00 am] 4          [01  27  2015 12:00:00 am] 5          [02  01  2015 12:00:00 am] </code></pre>   but how do i remove everything from the date except the year,python
what does it mean to have two parameters in a getattr()   from the python official doc  i saw the normal expression of getattr();    getattr(object  name[  default])    i understood it quite well. for example  i can do:   <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def a(): ...     pass ... &gt;&gt;&gt; c = 2 &gt;&gt;&gt; getattr(a   b   c) 2 </code></pre>   but in the code i m viewing now  the author use a pattern like:   <pre><code>getattr(a  b.x)(b.y) </code></pre>   and i even didn t find  b  in  a  object!    this confused me a lot  what does this code mean    <hr>   appendix 1:    the getattr() is between a plenty of import statements.  and the original expression is like:   <pre><code> from tornado.options import define  options  import settings         getattr(settings  options.env)(options.server_name) </code></pre>,python
c style chars in python  i m new to python programming but experienced in c.  i can t figure out what the equivalent to a char in python is.  from what i read there isn t one.  a  char  in python is a one character string.  in fact it might even be more than 1 byte if its unicode.  i need to create a packet of data using bytes (read chars) that s say 128 bytes long and may contain nulls.  i then want to write that packet to a serial port as a series of bytes not a string.    whats the python equivalent of:   <pre><code>char buffer[128]; buffer[12] =  0x04  buffer[15] =  0x00      ...etc </code></pre>,python

why does a python script to read files cause my computer to emit beeping sounds   i wrote a little module that will search files in a directory and all of its sub-directories for the occurrence of some input string. it s been handy a few times  mostly to find old scripts if i remember some function/variable name that i used.    so  i was completely baffled the other day when i used the functions and started hearing  very faintly  from the headphones sitting on the far side of my desk  repeated beeping sounds. at first i thought it was somebody s phone ringing. but no  python was communicating with me via morse code.    i have no clue why this is happening. i ve continued running the functions and getting beeps  not always in the same pattern. the functions only open files with read permission. the code is exactly this:   <pre><code>import os import glob  def directory_crawl_for_string(dir_name  string  ofile):        crawl dir_name and all of its subdirectories  opening files and     checking for the presence of a string         #get input directory s listings     dir_contents = glob.glob(dir_name)     #loop over the listings     for dir_element in dir_contents:         if(os.path.isfile(dir_element)):             #read the file  checking for the string             check_for_string(dir_element  string  ofile)         else:             if(os.path.isdir(dir_element)):                 directory_crawl_for_string(dir_element +  \\*   string  ofile)  def check_for_string(dir_element  string  ofile):      try:         ifile = open(dir_element   r )     except ioerror as e:         pass     else:         count = 1         for line in ifile:             if(string in line.lower()):                 print count line dir_element                 ofile.write( %s %d %s  % (dir_element  count  line))             count += 1         ifile.close()  def init_crawl(start_dir  string  output_dir):        args:             start_dir - directory to start the crawl at             string - string to search for             output_dir - directory to write output text file inside of         if(output_dir):         fn = output_dir.rstrip( / ).rstrip( \\ ) +  /dirs.txt      else:         fn =  dirs.txt      ofile = open(fn   w )     ofile.write( file path line number of occurance of  %s  exact line\n  % string)     directory_crawl_for_string(start_dir  string  ofile)     ofile.close()     print( list of files containing  %s  written to  %s   % (string  fn)) </code></pre>   to start it  you pass <code>init_crawl()</code> the directory to crawl down from  the string to search for  and a directory to write an output text file into. for example: <code>init_crawl(r c:\directory-to-crawl    foo   r c:\output-directory )</code>    i don t even know what specific questions to ask about this  but why is it happening  i can tell that the beeps generally occur when the function tries to read non-text files like pdfs and spreadsheets. sometimes the terminal freezes too...    the output is just a csv with columns for file paths where the string is found  line numbers  and the line containing the string.,python

sql insert if no record exists  i m trying to insert a couple of values into a table via php as follows:   <pre><code>$sql =  insert into table1(field1  field2)             values (    )              ;     $stmt = $db-&gt; prepare($sql);     $stmt-&gt;execute(array($field1  $field2));     $stmt-&gt;closecursor(); </code></pre>   field 1 is a primary key.    however  i only want to insert field1 if there is not already an instance of that record for field1 in the table (for example  if there s already a field1 record as  orange  it should not insert another  orange  if asked to do so).    i feel like this must be pretty straight forward to do but nothing i m trying seems to be working.,sql

ordered value by column / row  its a little difficult to explain. it might be easier to skip to the examples.    a table has an id and four columns that each allow null.    <pre><code>id  col1  col2  col3  col4 </code></pre>   there are x number of rows. ( usually less than 4 ) and only up to 4 distinct values will be used across the columns.    i am looking to return up to 4 rows  where each row in the resulting set is basically a column value where the value is selected left from right starting at the top preserving col number. if another row has a value that is not column unique it is shifted to the next available column.    examples:    if i have:   <pre><code>id  col1  col2  col3  col4   0   a     b           c   1               d     </code></pre>   i would like to return   <pre><code>a   b   d   c </code></pre>   and   <pre><code>id  col1  col2  col3  col4   0   a     b     d        1   c                 </code></pre>   gives   <pre><code>a   b   d   c  </code></pre>   and   <pre><code>id  col1  col2  col3  col4   0   a     b     d        1   c                   2   c                 </code></pre>   gives   <pre><code>a   b   d   c  </code></pre>   thanks!  the scenario when there are non unique columns and spaces between values can be thrown out.<br> this will not happen:   <pre><code>a b  d c    </code></pre>   this might help:   <pre><code>create table #original ( id int  a int  b int  c int  d int );  insert into #original --select 0 1 2 null 4 --union  --select 1 null null 3 null -- -- --select 0 1 2 3 null --union  --select 1 4 null null null -- -- select 0 1 2 4 null union  select 1 3 null null null  union  select 2 3 null null null   select * from #original order by id asc;  with cteoriginal as (     select *  rank() over (partition by [sortorder] order by id asc) as [nonuniquesortorder]     from     (         select id  a as [value]  1 as [sortorder]         from #original         where a is not null         union all         select id  b as [value]  2 as [sortorder]         from #original         where b is not null         union all         select id  c as [value]  3 as [sortorder]         from #original         where c is not null         union all         select id  d as [value]  4 as [sortorder]         from #original         where d is not null     ) as temp )  select [value] from ( select top 50 [value]  ((([nonuniquesortorder] - 1) * 4) + [sortorder]) sortedorder from cteoriginal order by sortedorder ) tmp group by [value] order by min(sortedorder)  drop table #original </code></pre>,sql

sql counting up records  i have a table reservation that holds hotels  costumers  pricing etc    now i want to make a sum per hotel by calculating my pricing.    i already have a query working that calculates the price for every record but now i want to see it added up per hotel.    this is what i have:   <pre><code>select c.naam ((d.prijs+e.prijs+f.prijs)*(a.eind_datum - a.start_datum) )as sum  from hotel c  kamer b  reservatie a  verblijfsformule d  verblijfsperiode e  kamertype f  where a.kamerid = b.kamerid and b.hotelid = c.hotelid and a.verblijfsformuleid =   d.verblijfsformuleid and a.verblijfsperiodeid = e.verblijfsperiodeid and b.kamertypeid =   f.kamertypeid  </code></pre>   if i run this query it gives me this result:   <pre><code>name -           sum hilton antwerp - 2100 hilton antwerp - 2250 consequat      - 2000 consequat      - 1200 hilton antwerp - 3000 </code></pre>   so as you can see it gives the right sum but instead of only giving hilton antwerp and consequat only 1 time and adding all those sums up per hotel it always gives it separately.    how can i resolve this problem    i tried with a group by a.hotelid  that gave me the 2 hotels but only with the sum of the first record it didn t add up then.    thanks in advance !,sql

storing search results for future use  i have the following scenario where the search returns a list of userid  values (1 2 3 4 5 6... etc.) if the search were to be run again  the results are guaranteed to change given some time. however i need to stored the instance of the search results to be used in the future.    we have a current implementation (legacy)  which creates a record for the search_id with the  criteria and inserts every row returned into a different table with the associated search_id.   <pre><code>table search_results    search_id unsigned int fk  pk (clustered index)    user_id unsigned int fk </code></pre>   this is an unacceptable approach as this table has grown onto millions of records. i ve considered partitioning the table  but either i will have numerous partitions (1000s).     i ve optimized the existing tables that search results expired unless they re used elsewhere  so all the search results are referenced elsewhere.    in the current schema  i cannot store the results as serialized arrays or xml. i am looking to efficiently store the search result information  such that it can be efficiently accessed later without being burdened by the number of records.     edit: thank you for the answers  i don t have any problems running the searches themselves  but the result set for the search gets used in this case for recipient lists  which will be used over and over again  the purpose of storing is exactly to have a snapshot of the data at the given time.,sql

how can i keep my records grouped together using sql   suppose i have a game table with the following fields    match_id  user_id  result    the results always come in pairs with identical match_id.  so for example   <pre><code>1837  4  win 1837  29  forfeit </code></pre>   i would like to separate into two groups  one group that has results and one group that doesn t.  this is pretty easily done by using <code>where result &lt;&gt;   </code>    however i ve noticed a few strange records such as the following   <pre><code>1839  5  win 1839  40  </code></pre>   the second record does not have a result recorded against it.  therefore using <code>result &lt;&gt;   </code> puts splits match 1839 into two separate groups whereas i want them to stay together.  can i achieve this in sql     so basically my pseudo code is:    if both have a result first group    if either have the result first group    if none have a result second group    full code using mysql   <pre><code>sql1: select * from game where result &lt;&gt;    </code></pre>   gives    <pre><code>1837  4  win 1837  29  forfeit 1839  5  win   sql2: select * from game where result =     1839  40  1850  30  1850  5  </code></pre>   i m looking for    sql1:      <pre><code>1837  4  win 1837  29  forfeit 1839  5  win 1839  40  </code></pre>   sql2:      <pre><code>1850  30  1850  5  </code></pre>,sql

sql count of related products via foreign key  we need to build a tree view with the group structure and a count of all the products that fit into each level below it like:   <pre><code>1 - drink related (120) &gt; 11 - plastic cups (70)   &gt; 111 - vending machine cups (20)      &gt; 1111 - vending machine cups 100-150cc (12)         o cup 1         o cup 2         etc..   &gt; 112 - party cups (25)   &gt; 113 - childrens cups (25) &gt; 12 - paper cups (50) 2 - food related (198) &gt; 21 - plastic plates (75) etc... </code></pre>   so  we have two tables. one holds products  one holds a group structure for the products. each product row contains only a direct foreign key link to the id of the group row it belongs to  so for example product id 42231 has a reference to group id 4 as it is a clear plastic cup of a certain size.  a product can fit in at any group level  it won t necessarily be always at the 4th group level if it doesn t fit a specific category. (so  for example  a new line of a drink cup may be dumped in group id 1  drink related  until it eventually gets its own category some months later.)    the group table (currently) has 1800 rows and basically forms a category tree. each group id is alphanumeric as some groups have too many variants to work with just numbers so:   <pre><code>id     gp1     gp2     gp3     gp4     desc 1      1       0       0       0       drink related 2      1       11      0       0       plastic cups 3      1       11      111     0       vending machine cups 4      1       11      111     1111    vending machine cups 100-150cc </code></pre>   if i only wanted to show the exact number of products in each id  i could do something like this:   <pre><code>select *  (select count(1)      from products     where groupid=g.id and isdeleted=0)      as groupproductcount  from groups g  order by g.group1  g.group2  g.group3  g.group4 </code></pre>   ...but i m after a more recursive count where it shows the count for all products below the current level so at a glance i can see there are 120 drink-related products within group 1 and not 3 which are directly in <em>group id</em> 1 at the moment.    personally i think i m going to have to get the dba to add in the 4 group levels to the product record too as otherwise for each record in the group table i d have to determine which level we re at (zeros in unused level  so a zero in group 4 means we re at level 3  zero in group 3 means we re at level 2  etc) and then scan through every product record (currently 10 000 and growing) to see if the group it falls in (read via the foreign key group id) has a level that matches the current group level record i m trying to count for.    i can t see that this can be achieved efficiently with just the group id in the product record. am i right here or am i missing something obvious,sql

in sql  trying to return a record for each instance where it triggers the from criteria  maybe i m looking at this problem all wrong  but here goes.    we have a database that is the backend for some crm software we use in the office. the boss wants a simple query to extract birthdays from clients and their spouses.    the table structure is as follows:   <pre><code>client details table: client name  client birthday  spouse name  spouse birthday  &lt;etc&gt; </code></pre>   i have a simple query with a case select that will determine if the client s birthday or the spouse s birthday is any time in the next month.     query is compacted as follows:   <pre><code>select a.* from   (select      (case    when &lt;birthday calculation&gt;               else null        end) as whohasbday        clientname        spousename    from      clientdetailstable) as a where    a.whohasbday is not null </code></pre>   this will return any entries where the client or the spouse has a birthday in the next x days.     however  if a client and their spouse has a birthday in the next x days  i would like the query to return the result once for each.     ie  here is the following data   <pre><code>client x: birthday in 5 days client y: spouse s birthday in 8 days client z: birthday in 3 days  spouse s birthday in 9 days. </code></pre>   the result set i want is   <pre><code>client x bday t+5 client y spouse bday t+8 client z bday t+3 client z spouse bday t+9 </code></pre>   perhaps i m approaching this problem the wrong way  in which case suggestion on a better method of attacking it would be appreciated. otherwise if there s a solution to this  please let me know.,sql

getting repeated rows for where with or condition  i am trying find employees that worked during a specific time period and the hours they worked during that time period. my query has to join the employee table that has employee id as pk and uses effective_date and expiration_date as time measures for the employee s position to the timekeeping table that has a pay period id number as pk and also uses effective and expiration dates.    the problem with the expiration date in the employee table is that if the employee is currently employed then the date is  12/31/9999 . i am looking for employees that worked in a certain year and current employees as well as the hours they worked separated by pay periods.    when i take this condition in account in the where with an or statement  i get duplicates that is employees that have worked the time period i am looking for and beyond as well as duplicate records for the  12/31/9999  and the valid employee in that time period.    this is the query i am using:   <pre><code>select             j.empl_id              j.dept              j.unit              j.last_nm              j.first_nm              j.title               j.eff_dt              j.exp_dt              tm1.pprd_id              tm1.empl_id              tm1.exp_dt              tm1.eff_dt              --pulling in the daily hrs worked               (select nvl(sum(((to_number(substr(ti.day_1  1                              instr(ti.day_1   :   1  1)-1) 99))*60)+                 (to_number(substr(ti.day_1                              instr(ti.day_1  :   -1  1)+1) 99))) 0)               from pprd_line ti               where               ti.pprd_id=tm1.pprd_id               )  day1               ---and the rest of the days for the work period     from    pprd_line tm1     join    empl j on tm1.empl_id=j.empl_id   where     j.empl_id= some id number  --for test purposes  will need to break down to depts-     and     j.eff_dt &gt;=to_date( 1/1/2012   mm/dd/yyyy )     and     (     j.exp_dt&lt;=to_date( 12/31/2012   mm/dd/yyyy )     or     j.exp_dt=to_date( 12/31/9999   mm/dd/yyyy ) --i think the problem might be here        )  group by      j.empl_id      j.dept      j.unit      j.last_nm      j.first_nm      j.title       j.eff_dt      j.exp_dt      tm1.pprd_id      tm1.empl_id      tm1.doc_id      tm1.exp_dt      tm1.eff_dt  order by     j.eff_dt      tm1.eff_dt      tm1.exp_dt </code></pre>   i m pretty sure i m missing something simple but at this point i can t see the forest for the trees. can anyone out there point me in the right direction     an example of the duplicate records:    for employee 1 for the year of 2012:   <pre><code>empl_id dept unit   last     first   title   eff date exp date   pprd id empl_id 00001   04   012    babbage  charles somejob 4/1/2012 10/15/2012 0407123 00001   exp date_1 eff date_1 4/15/2012  4/1/2012 </code></pre>   this record repeats 3 times and goes past the pay periods in 2012 to the current pay period in 2013    the subquery i use to convert time to be able to add hrs and mins together to compare down the line.,sql

get number of occurrences taking 1 for every 3 days group  i ve got a table for employees that usually get late to work. i need to send a report to human resources showing every user that got late  taking into account that i just can count a warning per user if that user got late in a period of 3 days at least 1 time within period.    the first data i need is the total number of warnings to be sent for hr manager to evaluate global  lateness .    users that got late just one day will receive one warning  but if they got late twice or more the warnings they ll receive depend if they received a warning within a 3 days period counting from day one.    let s see with an example:   <ul> <li>joe    monday  9th</li> <li>mark   monday  9th</li> <li>tim    monday  9th</li> <li>joe    tuesday 10th</li> <li>joe   wednesday 11th</li> <li>joe    thursday 12th</li> <li>tim    friday 13th</li> </ul>   taking the data from table above as an example.    joe will receive 2 warnings: first for monday  and second for thursday. tuesday and wednesday will be discarded because they belonged to the same 3 day period.    mark will receive just one warning for monday.    tim will receive 2 warnings. first for monday and second for friday.    maybe this number is not possible to get using standard sql query and some cursors need to be done.    thanks in advance,sql

sql condition based dataset  i have a sql server database that i did not design.  the employees have degrees  licensures and credentials stored in a few different tables.  i have written the query to join all of this information together so i can see an over all result of what the data looks like. i have been asked to create a view for this data that returns only the highest degree they have obtained and the two highest certifications. the problem is  as it is pre existing data  there is no hierarchy built into the data. all of the degrees and certifications are simply stored as a string associated with their employee number.  the first logical step was to create an adjacency list(i believe this is the correct term). for example  md  is the highest degree you can obtain in our list. so i have given that the  ranking  of 1. the next lower degree is  ranked  as 2. and so forth.  i can join on the text field that contains these and return their associated rank.  the problem i am having is returning only the two highest based on this ranking.  if the employee has multiple degrees or certifications they are listed on a second or third row. from a logical standpoint  i need to group the employee id  first name and last name. then some how concatenate the degrees  certifications and licensures based on the  ranking  i created for them. it is not a true hierarchy in the way that i am thinking about it because i only need to know the highest two and not necessarily the relationship between the results.    another potential caveat is that the database must remain in sql server 2000 compatibility mode.    any help that can be given would be much appreciated. thank you.   <pre><code>select a.edurank as  licensure rank      b.edurank as  degree rank      empcomp.eecempno     emppers.eepnamefirst      emppers.eepnamelast      rtrim(empeduc.efelevel)     rtrim(emplicns.elclicenseid)     a.edutype     b.edutype        from empcomp        join emppers on empcomp.eeceeid = emppers.eepeeid       join empeduc on empcomp.eeceeid = empeduc.efeeeid       join emplicns on empcomp.eeceeid = emplicns.elceeid       join yvdegreeranks a on a.educode = emplicns.elclicenseid       join yvdegreeranks b on b.educode = empeduc.efelevel </code></pre>,sql

sql joining tables only on specific rows  i am looking for a general response as to the mindset of how to do this... i have a table that has a column full of possible parameters and a column full of possible values. i want to join all parameters of a certain kind to another table to give further description of those specific rows  but not have that table joined to all other rows that don t contain the specific value. it would look like this:   <pre><code>parameters  values   mammal    a          1             b          3    d         cat      yes    c          4    d         dog      yes    e          3    d         fish      no    f          2 </code></pre>   i ve tried a number of ways using case  however the table just gets very weird and there was repetition of the table being joined depending on its length. any suggestions     the second table has two columns  it is being joined on its own animal column to the values column where <strong>parameter =  d </strong>. it does not show up at all when parameter equals anything else. any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

how to write a select statement when i don t know in advance what columns i want   my application has several tables: a master object table  and several tables for storing specific kinds of objects: cat  shoe and book.    here s an idea of what the table columns look like:   <h2>object</h2>  <pre><code>object_id    (primary key) object_type  (string) </code></pre>  <h2>cat</h2>  <pre><code>cat_id       (primary key) object_id    (foreign key) name         (string) color        (string) </code></pre>  <h2>shoe</h2>  <pre><code>shoe_id      (primary key) object_id    (foreign key) model        (string) size         (string) </code></pre>  <h2>book</h2>  <pre><code>book_id      (primary key) object_id    (foreign key) title        (string) author       (string) </code></pre>   from the user s point of view  each specific object is primarily identified by its name  which is a different column for each table. for the cat table it s name  for the shoe table it s model  and for the book table it s title.    let s say i m handed an object_id without knowing in advance what kind of object it represents -- a cat  a shoe or a book.  how do i write a select statement to get this information     obviously it would look a little like this:   <pre><code>select object_type name from object where object_id = 12345; </code></pre>   but how do i get the right contents in the  name  column,sql

about dual table structure in oracle sql *plus  we know that  dual  is a temporary table which exactly contains 1 column whose name is  dummy   which is of  varchar2(1)  type that has 1 single row. the value of that record is  x . the varchar2 has size of 1 which means it should not allow more than a single character.  now my question is: if it is of varchar2 type  then why it can hold any datatype temporarily and if we insert characters more than 1 (size)  how this is possible for it (dual) to accept it   example:    <pre><code>sql&gt; desc dual   name                            null     type  ------------------------------- -------- ----  dummy                                    varchar2(1)  sql&gt; select sysdate from dual;  sysdate --------- 22-jan-13  sql&gt; select 5*5 result from dual;     result ---------        25  sql&gt; select  ankita  as  name  from dual;  name ------ ankita </code></pre>   clearly  sysdate  is of date type (not varchar2)   result  is of number type (not varchar2). also  ankita  is more than 1 single character  i.e.  6 characters. this should contradict the structure that varchar2 is holding only 1  and supporting 6 too..,sql

counting frequently changing values on the database  i am building a social network site for educational purposes and was wondering how should i efficiently count  tweets  of a user (if for ex. on the tweets table he has 100k entries). should i do it via sql count() or should i add a  no. of tweets  field per user to fetch easily and update it when user add/delete a tweet  or if there are better approach on this  i d deeply appreciate your input.    how about the case of counting the total no. of characters of these  tweets   is sum(char_length(arg)) efficient  or caching an updated value better     let s say these values (no. of tweets and no. of characters for all tweets) are always being called because they are displayed publicly on their profiles  and <strong>on average</strong>  these numbers are getting called once per second and their values change once every 30 seconds.    i am just experimenting on algorithms involving large data  so a big thanks if you can help!    another thing  is php &amp; mariadb fit for this kind of process  or other stack are better,sql

sql knowing when to split tables  i am creating a database that tracks replays for a game. each replay has a different game mode that is either team-based gameplay or individual-based gameplay. depending on the game mode  i want to record the winning team or the winning individual.    i have the following mysql table that tracks rounds in the replay and the associated winner:   <pre><code>create table replay_rounds (     replay_id int unsigned not null      round smallint unsigned not null      winning_player_id int unsigned      winning_team_id tinyint unsigned      foreign key (replay_id) references replays(id)      foreign key (replay_id  winning_player_id) references replay_players(replay_id  player_id)      foreign key (winning_team_id) references teams(id)      primary key (replay_id  round)) character set=utf8 collate=utf8_general_ci engine=innodb; </code></pre>   using what i have now  if the game mode is team-based then i will set the winning_team_id for each round and set the winning_player_id to <code>null</code>. likewise  if the game mode is individual-based  i will set the winning_team_id to <code>null</code>.    performance-wise and in terms of best practice  is it all right to leave it like this  is there a compelling reason to split this into a separate table for each game mode (even if there s only two modes)  how about a hypothetical situation where game modes are constantly being added -- would this be best resolved by creating a table for every new game mode,sql

sql - when i join an additional table  it adds rows to my results that i don t want to count  i m learning sql  for the second time  and i m not able to figure out how to join an additional table (that s required to access a field in that table that i want to sum)  without it returning additional rows to the results  as that is giving me incorrect counts.    that is my problem  as i see it  but maybe my approach is wrong.    what i need to accomplish is to total the itemprice s that are found in the orderitems table  per customer  for all their orders. i have done that  but not without getting the wrong counts for the number of orders  due to having to join that additional table.    here is the abbreviated code for the problem i m working on  followed by the results.  the results from running the code as-is on the left  and the results by un-commenting the 2 lines on the right.   <pre><code>select  customers.firstname  orders.customerid  count(*) as numoforders  from orders     join customers         on orders.customerid=customers.customerid --  join orderitems --      on orderitems.orderid=orders.orderid  group by customers.firstname  orders.customerid having count(*) &gt; 1 order by numoforders desc   fname     id    count                 fname      id    count ---------------------                 ---------------------- david      4    3                     allan       1    3 heather    8    2                     david       4    3 kris      18    2                     frank       6    3 bette     29    2                     heather     8    2 allan      1    2                     simona     14    2                                       kris       18    2                                       yuki       27    2                                       bette      29    2                                       chanel     35    2 </code></pre>,sql

sql query - select value from t1 where second value fully met in t2  i can do this in an ugly stored procedure with temp tables and whatnot  but i know an experienced developer could do this so much more elegantly than what i ve come up with. in fact  i d kind of rather not have to call the sproc at all  but just have one query that gives me what i need.    i m working with two tables:    <ul> <li>t1 billingdirectivesneeded </li> <li>t2 billingdirectives.</li> </ul>   t1 has two fields relevant to this task -    <ul> <li>pkey </li> <li>wbs1. </li> </ul>   there will be many pkeys associated with each wbs1.    t2 has only one field of interest   <ul> <li>pkey.</li> </ul>   the task i m trying to address is geting a list of wbs1s from t1 that have all of their needed directives in t2 before i enable their import.      we want to import a wbs1 only when all of the pkeys for that wbs1 are found in t2.  if not  i ll just leave them grayed out.    i ve tried a dozen different ways to get this to happen over the last few hours  and i seem to have a mental block.   the pseudo-code would look something like this:   <pre><code>select t1.wbs1 from billingdirectiveneeded t1  where [all the t1.pkeys for t1.wbs1 can be found in billingdirectives t2] </code></pre>,sql

redundant user generated data in a database - how to structure  e.g.  recipes share ingredients  i m building a website for which a large amount of user generated data will be stored in a back end db and will be discoverable by all users.    by its nature  a portion of the user entries will be redundant.  for the sake of example  let s imagine this data is made of recipes.  suppose the following entries:    <em>title: lemony dressing:<br> - 1 tbsp lemon juice<br> - 2 tbsp olive oil<br> just mix!</em>    and    <em>title: lemony marinade:<br> - 2 tbsp lemon juice<br> - 2 tbsp olive oil<br> - 1 tbsp soy sauce<br> just mix the ingredients together!</em>    clearly  those 2 entries have some redundant information: half the title is shared  the instructions are shared partially  one ingredient is shared exactly  another ingredient is partially shared....    furthermore  one could easily imagine a recipe made of several sub-recipes  which can also exist on their own.  so for example  you could have a <em>marinated flank steak</em> recipe that uses the <em>lemony marinade</em> as a step.  so recipes can be defined recursively.    my question is how should i structure my sql recipe database   my gut feeling is that it makes sense to store the entry  lemon juice  in an <em>ingredients</em> table  the quantity  2 tbsp  in a <em>quantity</em> one  and then use their keys in the <em>recipe</em> table.    but how far should i go   should i split  lemon juice  into two entries  in order to prevent duplication with  orange <strong>juice</strong>  and  <strong>lemon</strong> zest    after all  ingredients can also be defined recursively.    but then sentences can too  and instructions on how to use the ingredients are going to have some overlap - but over the long term maybe not all that much.  does it make sense then to store each word separately   why not letters     i m not sure how to consider the trade-offs like this.  i suppose that if i minimize the redundancy of the info in the tables  there must be some cost.  is it performance wise  or is it a cost paid at conception     thank you     jdelage,sql

how can i search the entire sql database for a specific column name  and then search only those columns for a specific value   at work  we use an absolutely massive database with multiple different programs writing to the main bucket. unfortunately  there s not always a good way to know from those individual programs where specific data points might be written to the database. i have a query that can search everything for a specific value or string  but because of the size of the database  it usually takes about 7 hours to complete.     i thought that if i could narrow the search a bit  i might be able to speed that up. a lot of the values i often have to look up would be under similarly named columns (i.e.  username    userid   etc.) is there a good way to do a search that looks through all of my tables for a specific column name  and then searches only those columns for the value that i m trying to locate     i found a similar question asked a few years back     <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17362695/search-sql-database-for-a-column-name-then-search-for-a-value-within-the-retune/17363526#17363526 newreg=60d4b0ef5e9745dab1333dcb6761f5a7 >search sql database for a column name  then search for a value within the retuned columns</a>    but when i run the answer  all it returns is  command(s) completed successfully.     i m still a little green at this  so i m not discounting the fact that it could be a picnic issue on my end.,sql

many-to-many relationship between tables - how to model in sql  i m just wondering what the best implementation for a simple example like this is.    if i have 2 tables below and a unit has multiple upgrades which are variable amounts i was thinking of holding a list of ids of upgrades in an csv format then i d load the unit and extract the ids from the list of upgrade ids.    i just feel like there might be a better way to implement this because it s been quite a while since i ve worked in sql and i m not sure if this is best practice or any issue that i might not foresee.    tables    unit { id name upgrades }    upgrade { id name description },sql
count n-tuples in sql  i have a table with two int columns  the combination of them is unique.   <pre><code>ids  idk --------- 1    2 1    3 1    4  2    2 2    3 2    4  3    2 3    5 3    4  4    2 4    3 </code></pre>   what i want is to get the biggest set of idks which is common to at least 2 ids.    the result here should look like this:   <pre><code>(2 3 4) - 2x (2 4) - 3x (2 3) - 3x (3 4) - 2x (2 5) - 1x </code></pre>   as you see  the number of common idks is the most important thing. if the number is the same #(2 4) = #(2 5) then the criterion is the number of occurencies.    it seems to me rather like a algorithm which needs to be programmed but i may be wrong and sql is capable of it.,sql
sql splitting time when over midnight  i am after some guidance on the best way to get useful information out of our mis database    scenario:- i want to check staff utilisation by a variable period that i can drill down into. this needs to then be split into days so i can assess over a 24 hour period what was done    the table is huge and has loads of columns we need to calculate  so ideally i need to split the records that span 2 days into 2    the table has a datetimeformat field that has user [starttime]  it then has a separate field that has [duration] which is in decimal hours.    so an example would be:   <pre><code>id   starttime              duration      qty      username 1    2016-11-24 23:00:00       2.00       1000      joe bloggs </code></pre>   in the example above joe starts at 11pm and works till 1 am  so what i need is to somehow split this record in my query to put anything before midnight as 1 record and anything after into another this example is pretty simple as it is half/half but some might start at 10pm and finish at 6pm so i would need 2 hours and 6 hours.    not sure on the best way to do this  my initial thoughts was to create a cte where a start time is in 1 day and if the starttime + duration was in the next day then split the record.    not sure if there is an easier way or if anyone has had to do this before.    any help appreciated,sql

double inner join with grouping  here s one for the sql junkies:    i have two tables: student names and student registrations. a student will register 1 or 2 times in a year  and over the course of a degree 8 to 10 times. i want to pull up all the students currently in the system (i.e. all students in 2013)  which i do with the following:   <pre><code>select studentkey  lastname  firstname  count(year) as registrations     from  uctprogrammesregistered      left join uctstudents     on uctstudents.studentnumber=uctprogrammesregistered.studentkey     where programmeregistered=  .$programmecode.   and year=  .$year.        group by studentkey  lastname  firstname     order by studentkey  lastname </code></pre>   this gives me the result with the number of times registered in the current year. however  what i really want is the number of times ever registered by the students over all previous years registered. note this can t be solved by just relaxing the year=$year part of the where since that will give me all students ever registered in the institution. i just want from the students presently registered to know how many times this group of students registered.    i thought using the join statement multiple times should help (i.e. include another join on the same table uctprogrammesregistered  but somehow with only where programmeregistered=  .$programmecode.   and leaving off the year check - that would work  but sql doesn t seem to cooperate with this idea.,sql

how do i set order by in sql query to a value depending by the sql query itself   imagine an auction (ebay auction  for example). you create an auction  set the start bidding value  let s say  5 dollars. this gets stored as a minimal bid value to the <code>auctions</code> table.at this point  the <strong>current</strong> bid value of this auction is <strong>5 dollars</strong>.    now  if someone bids to your auction  let s say  10 dollars  this gets stored to the <code>bids</code> table.at this point  the <strong>current</strong> bid value of this auction is <strong>10 dollars</strong>.    now let s imagine you want to retrieve 5 cheapest auctions. you will write a query like this:   <pre><code>select `auction_id`  `auction_startprice`  max(bids.bid_price) as `bid_price` from `auctions` left join `bids` on `auctions`.`auction_id`=`bids`.`bid_belongs_to_auction` group by `auction_id` limit 5 </code></pre>   pretty simple  and it works! but now you need to add an <code>order by</code> clause to the query. the problem is  however  that we want to <code>order by</code> <strong>either</strong> by <code>auctions.auction_startprice</code> <strong>or</strong> by <code>bid_price</code>  depending on <strong>whichever of this is higher</strong>  as explained in the first paragraphs.    can this be understood  i know how to do this using 2 queries  but i am hoping it can be done with 1 query.    thanks!    edit: just a further explanation to help you imagine the problem. if i set <code>order by auction_startprice asc</code>  then i will get 5 auctions with their lowest initial bid price  but what if there are already bids placed on those auctions  then their current lowest price is equal to those bids  not to the start price  therefore my query is wrong.,sql

what are the disadvantages of having tons of &nbsp; entities   i ve been writing a source-to-display converter for a small project. basically  it takes an input and transforms the input into an output that is displayable by the browser (think wikipedia-like).    the idea is there  but it isn t like the mediawiki style  nor is like the markdown style. it has a few <em>innovations</em> by itself. for example  when the user types in a chain of spaces  i would presume he wants the spaces preserved. since html ignores spaces by default  i was thinking of converting these chain of spaces into respective <code>&amp;nbsp;</code>s (for example 3 spaces in a row converted to 1 <code>&amp;nbsp;</code>)    so what happens is that i can foresee a possibility of a ton of <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> tags per post (and a single page may have multiple posts).    i ve been hearing alot of anti-&amp;nbsps in the web  but most of it boils down to readability headaches (in this case  the input is supplied by the user. if he decides to make his post unreadable he can do so with any of the other formatting actions supplied) or maintenance headaches (which in this case is not  since it s a converted output).    i m wondering what are the disadvantages of having tons of <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> tags on a webpage,html

can same id address multiple elements in html   from what i ve learned from other posts <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/a/12889416/3429430 >like this</a>  i get that one id cannot work on more than one type of element. but the following code works well:   <pre><code>&lt;!doctype html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;style&gt; #p01 { color: blue; } &lt;/style&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;h1 id= p01 &gt; heading&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;this is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id= p01 &gt;this is a diff paragraph.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;this is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id= p01 &gt;i am different.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; </code></pre>   i ve used the <code>p01</code> id for two elements <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> respectively. i am new to html; perhaps i mistook some concept. there should not be a contradiction. please tell me what i am understanding wrong..,html
is there a row alternative for <th> in html   so i want to render a timetable in html  such that each column has a title (the day) and each row has a title (the time). i ve just found out that <a href= http://www.w3schools.com/html5/tag_th.asp  rel= nofollow >you can only use <code>&lt;th&gt;</code> for titles in the <code>&lt;thead&gt;</code> section</a>  and i can t find an alternative for creating titles for the rows. i m currently using the <code>&lt;th&gt;</code>s and their id s to give headers to the timetable entries. the values of the header are then used to enter data into those cells. so is there any way to add titles to rows so i can preserve this behaviour,html
creating tables with different sized cells  i want to make my form to look neat and i want my cells to be different sizes depending on the information in the cell. how do i make a cell width different then the one above it     ok now i also want to know how to make 1 cell tall and have a lot of small cells to the right of it.    example:   <pre><code>  &lt;html&gt;   &lt;table border= 1 &gt;&lt;td width= 50 &gt;some info&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td width= 50 &gt;some more info&lt;/td&gt;   &lt;tr&gt;   &lt;td width= 250 &gt;lots more text and information in this box then the first cell&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;     other information&lt;/td&gt; </code></pre>   i don t want the first cell in the first row to automatically resize to the length of the first cell in the second row.    example:   <pre><code>|some info|some more info|  |lots more text and information in this box then the first cell|other information| </code></pre>   or is there at least another way to lay this out that would look clean,html

access servlet get method on button  without making form possible   i have created an html file  which include 4 buttons. i want to access get/post method in my servlet  newoperator  from the second button.    so if you click on it  it should start the get method automatic.    my code so far:   <pre><code>&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;          &lt;p align= center &gt;              &lt;a href= create.jsp  class= button &gt;create new operator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;         &lt;/p&gt;          &lt;p align= center &gt;              &lt;a action= newoperator  class= button &gt;show operators&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;         &lt;/p&gt;          &lt;p align= center &gt;              &lt;a href= create.jsp  class= button &gt;update an operator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;         &lt;/p&gt;          &lt;p align= center &gt;              &lt;a href= create.jsp  class= button &gt;delete an operator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;         &lt;/p&gt; </code></pre>   as you can see  the first button will open create.jsp. this is working just fine  but if i want to run a get method in a servlet  how can this be done without making a form     i tried it withs the forms  like:   <pre><code>&lt;form method= get  action= newoperator &gt;         &lt;input type= submit  value= show all operators &gt;     &lt;/form&gt; </code></pre>   this is working fine also  but then i can t get the same style i have created with css!    hope someone got an answer,html
new to rich snippets (html)  how do i put them in my code   i ve seen the question [how to implement rich snippets] but my question is a little more basic (since i m not the best at html).    in <a href= https://developers.google.com/structured-data/rich-snippets/recipes  rel= nofollow >https://developers.google.com/structured-data/rich-snippets/recipes</a> the example code is   <pre><code>&lt;div itemscope itemtype= http://schema.org/product &gt;   &lt;span itemprop= brand &gt;acme&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span itemprop= name &gt;executive anvil&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;img itemprop= image  src= anvil_executive.jpg  alt= executive anvil logo  /&gt;   &lt;span itemprop= description &gt;sleeker than acme s classic anvil  the     executive anvil is perfect for the business traveler     looking for something to drop from a height.   &lt;/span&gt;   product #: &lt;span itemprop= mpn &gt;925872&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span itemprop= aggregaterating  itemscope itemtype= http://schema.org/aggregaterating &gt;     &lt;span itemprop= ratingvalue &gt;4.4&lt;/span&gt; stars  based on &lt;span itemprop= reviewcount &gt;89       &lt;/span&gt; reviews   &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span itemprop= offers  itemscope itemtype= http://schema.org/offer &gt;     regular price: $179.99     &lt;meta itemprop= pricecurrency  content= usd  /&gt;     $&lt;span itemprop= price &gt;119.99&lt;/span&gt;     (sale ends &lt;time itemprop= pricevaliduntil  datetime= 2020-11-05 &gt;       5 november!&lt;/time&gt;)     available from: &lt;span itemprop= seller &gt;executive objects&lt;/span&gt;     condition: &lt;link itemprop= itemcondition  href= http://schema.org/usedcondition /&gt;previously owned        in excellent condition     &lt;link itemprop= availability  href= http://schema.org/instock /&gt;in stock! order now!&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>   i m wondering  do i just copy and paste this into the html on my page  (with my information obviously). will it mess up my page  change the formatting  will anything display on my page  or will it just act like a comment but search crawlers from google will realize what it is and make use of it.    also  how long after i add this code to an existing page (that google as already indexed) will the google search results be updated to show the rich text snippet     thanks!,html

background property does not work for jpg  i want to show a background image for my web page and i have one jpg for that purpose. i am using ie 8 and notepad to write my html page. so i preferred to use <code>body</code> tag with background property set to the image path. very simple! but to my surprise  it does not show the image at all. when i tried the same path inside an img tag on same page  it works. also  when i tried another jpg in the <code>body</code> tag  it also worked!   <pre><code>&lt;body background= images/myimage.jpg &gt; ... ... &lt;/body&gt; </code></pre>   finally  i decided to convert the image into png format and then it worked.   <pre><code>&lt;body background= images/myimage.png &gt; ... ... &lt;/body&gt; </code></pre>   am i missing anything here in jpg case  or body tag does not support jpg of particular size  something like that  this looks strange behavior to me. any help appreciated.. thanks!,html

philosophically  why can t markup be binary data  i.e. why can t we compile html for the web   given the vast efforts to make the web as efficient as possible  why can t html (and all the various other plain text files e.g. css  javascript) be compiled into a single resource and sent down the wire  (i m aware of <a href= http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/microsoft_compiled_html_help  rel= nofollow noreferrer >.chm files</a> - these are along the lines of this concept).    i understand the open nature of the web - an effort i stand behind - but one could conceive of an open specification that requires multiple resources compile down into binary. decomplication by the user-agent could be required by the specification (this allowing individuals to view the dom etc.)    i guess i m just surprised  given the efforts at performance in other areas  we re still relying on plain text to push around pages  or am i just over-estimating the savings a binary format would provide,html

side menu of website altered by new search box  i have a problem with my website when viewed in internet explorer (the problem only occurs in internet explorer). my website is designed mainly using dreamweaver in html. you can view the page in question here:     <a href= http://www.glucosemeters4u.com  rel= nofollow >http://www.glucosemeters4u.com</a>     i recently added a seach box at the top of the site with a logo pic and cart link. the addition of the search box has caused a problem with the left side menu. if you scroll down you can see what this problem is. basically the menu is about 171 pixels wide until bottom where it suddenly becomes double the size.     if i remove the search box  this problem is reduced. if i remove the logo the problem is gone and the left side menu at the bottom goes back to its normal length.     i think the problem is something to do with the coding with the seach box but i can t work it out. any ideas  i have basic html coding knowledge so please bear that in mind with any answers.     thanks,html

jump to anchor tag with shim to offset page position and change div color  i have a google map with right sidebar. search results come from a database and it displays map icons on a map with a list of names and addresses in the sidebar and it works correctly  however the list can have 100 s of entries  not all are visible without scrolling the sidebar  however scrolling works fine but is tedious with 100 s of data entries...    so...    i am using href # to jump to anchor tags in the sidebar when a user clicks on a map icon and this also works fine and displays (jumps to) the appropriate data entry which is wrapped in a div except that the target position that is displayed is behind my navbar which is fixed. this is because the anchor tag display position is  by default  the top of the page and i need to push the target data entry down by some 50px only when a map icon is clicked.    i can add height= 50px  to a div and this pushes down the list in the sidebar to the correct position when a user clicks a map icon but the problem is it adds 50px to each entry in the list whether a user clicks a map icon or not.    so what i would ideally like to do is add a height= 50px  shim (height offset) to the relevant entry so that is positioned 50px below the navbar and change it s div background color. i have tried lots of ideas  but either the 50px shim is applied to each entry (not desired) or is ignored and also background color is ignored. i have checked out some other similar answers but they don t seem to apply because i am already using div #id and div .class. any ideas    <pre><code>function createmarker(point  map  infowindow  html  companyname) { var marker = new google.maps.marker({   position: point    map: map    icon:  mapicons/ +idcategory+ .png     url:  # +companyname    title: companyname }); </code></pre>   // the following is the sidebar   <pre><code>    side_bar_html += &lt;div id=   +companyname+    class= companyname &gt;&lt;a href= javascript:myclick(  +(gmarkers.length-0)+  ) &gt;  +companyname+  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n +      &lt;p align= justify  class= text &gt;  +companydescription+  &lt;/p&gt;\n +      &lt;/div&gt; ;   google.maps.event.addlistener(marker   click   function() { window.location.href = this.url; }); </code></pre>,html

how to hide missing video link in html  working on an html file that will only be used on my computer  nothing to be put up on the web.  i found html is much faster for what i m trying to do than either vb or python.  it searches a webpage for video files that are up on the webpage  some are there  some not.  the trouble is i don t want it to display a clickable link unless the video is on the webpage.  is there anyway to do this     example of what i ve tried:    embed src= http://www.a.com/videos/1234567.mp4 >1234567    a href= http://www.a.com/videos/1234567.mp4 >1234567    naturally a href and embed will give you the  link   including when no file is there.  i would much rather have it only show a clickable link when a file is present that i can download.  is it possible with html only.  is there anyway to work around the situation to accomplish what i m trying using only html.    i could live with embed if i could right click on it and save the video that way but without a plugin i can t...not actually sure if i could if i was including a plugin in the code or not.  then again  under the circumstance that would be a tricky situation when transferring the file to be used from a my laptop to a tablet which is the intended direction i m leaning if i can get all my programs to run without the need for vb or quite frankly python...most everything is internet based programs so if i can get things rewritten using html than i may actually be able to pull this crazy idea off.,html

how are different html elements equivalent   some html elements (<code>&lt;div&gt;</code>  <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>  <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>  <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>  <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>  ...  <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> <code>&lt;b&gt;</code>  <code>&lt;i&gt;</code>  and so on) seem to behave the same way except for default styling. for example  <code>&lt;span style= font-weight: bold; &gt; x &lt;/span&gt;</code> seems equivalent to <code>&lt;b&gt; x &lt;/b&gt;</code>. some elements such as <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> have special properties but behave mostly the same way.    can someone make this precise     in particular  is there a subset of elements that  covers  all of html    <hr>   <strong>edit:</strong> i understand that elements are meant to carry semantics. but suppose that i don t care about semantics  and i only want to deal with the smallest subset of html that will give me access to some given <em>browser behavior</em>. i m wondering how to find that subset.,html

possible to open window without controls using anchor attributes   is it possible to open a new window without controls / scrollbar  etc using only a link or is javascript required to do that   not having much luck on a javascript-less solution.    something like   <pre><code>&lt;a href= mysite.com/videoplayer.php v=1234  target= _blank  controls= false &gt;popout player&lt;/a&gt; </code></pre>   no idea what the attributes might be  just wondering if this is possible.    we are being asked to produce a paste-able link that will behave similar to a flash based popout video player.  my guess is this isn t possible  but i wanted to make sure first.  they just want the video player inside a window without a restricted set of controls (no back button  refresh  editable address bar  etc).  i have control over what goes inside the window  i just won t be able to use javascript on the link.,html

keyword re-use in header <h1> and <h2> tags - best practices  i have a company profile with multiple tabs.  is it advisable to re-use the company name in the h1 and h2 header tags.  for example    american express is the -- h1    and then there are tabs about earnings  management team  stock ratings  etc.    should the tabs have h2 tags which read:    american express earnings american express management team etc    or should they be without the company name repeated given the co. name has the h1 header  e.g. :    earnings management team etc    would google consider option 1 keyword stuffing of some variety or would google better crawl the pages more as it knows what is on them     thanks  paul,html

dynamically specify height of parent based on the tallest child element   i am trying to best figure out how to set two columns  a-elements to 100% of the parent element  without specifying this height  but having it chosen based on the taller of the two columns. at the same time  i want to vertically align the a-element within it s column.    current code:   <pre><code>&lt;div class= post-nav group &gt;                  &lt;div class= post-nav-prev &gt;                     &lt;div class= post-nav-border border-reset-right &gt;                     &lt; php previous_post( %        yes );  &gt;                     &lt;/div&gt;                 &lt;/div&gt;                 &lt;div class= post-nav-next &gt;                     &lt;div class= post-nav-border &gt;                     &lt; php next_post( %        yes );  &gt;                     &lt;/div&gt;                 &lt;/div&gt;              &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>   css:    <pre><code>.post-nav {  }  .post-nav-prev  .post-nav-next {     float: left;     width: 50%;     height: 100%; }  .post-nav-prev a  .post-nav-next a {     display: flex;     justify-content: center; /* align horizontal */     align-items: center; /* align vertical */     height: 100%;     padding: 10px;       }  .post-nav-prev a {     padding-left: 25px; }  .post-nav-next a {     padding-right: 25px; }  .post-nav-border {     border: 1px solid #e3e3e3;     height: 100%; } </code></pre>   what i eventually run into as the problem is when the two post titles isn t the same amount of lines. i originally had a specified height  but this isn t optimal for the responsive aspect of the website.     so to clarify: how would i go about having the tallest of  .post-nav-prev a   and  .post-nav-next a  specify a height for .post-nav  so the other of the two a elements also get 100% height. i ve seen suggestions for display: table  but i couldn t quite get that to work  as well as keeping the vertical alignment of display: flex.    any suggestions,html

div float left without set height  working on a new site and having issues floating divs left with the overflow wrapping to the next line.     sample: <a href= http://gohmm.matthewgideon.com/get-involved/sponsorships/  rel= nofollow noreferrer >http://gohmm.matthewgideon.com/get-involved/sponsorships/</a>    you ll notice when you reduce the size of the browser - the 1st set of images at the bottom are correct  but they should wrap to the next line after they reach 100% across the screen.     if i add a height to the divs it works  but i did not want to set a height. here is the basic coding i m using.   <pre><code>#sponsorshipwrapper { margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 100%;}  #sponsorship { display: block; float: left; padding: 0 20px 40px; width: calc(20% - 40px); } </code></pre>   ultimately i m trying to pull a query of posts and place the in a grid pattern  left to right.,html

limit the size of an file upload (html input)  i would like to simply limit the size of a file that a user can upload.    i thought maxlength = 20000 = 20k but that doesn t seem to work at all.        i am running on rails  not php  but was thinking it d be much simpler to do it client side in the html/css  or as a last result with jquery. this is so basic though that there must be some html tag i am missing or not aware of.    looking to support ie7+  chrome  ff3.6+. i suppose i could get away with just supporting ie8+ if necessary.    thanks.,html

html table background not working  hello i currently am helping out an organization that uses a very basic website. they lack any css capabilities and i have had to code purely in html (which is far from fun). however i seem to be running into a issue. whenever i run the code on the website a table s background fails to show up.   <pre><code>table style =  background: url(image.png)  </code></pre>   this is how i coded the table  and i don t believe i made a mistake there because when i plug it into an html editor it works perfectly fine. am i simply working with an outdated version of html  or is what i m asking for impossible with this website  any help would be greatly appreciated.    here is my code if it could clear up any confusion   <pre><code>&lt;table style= height: 10px; border-color: #000000; background:  url( http://i.imgur.com/2jxgsxt.jpg )  center  no-repeat; background-size:  100%;  width= 100% &gt; &lt;tbody&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style= text-align: center; width: 15%;  bgcolor=  &gt;&lt;span style= color:  #ffffff; &gt;&lt;strong&gt;feb.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style= color: #ffffff; &gt;&lt;strong&gt;23rd-25th&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style= width: 5%;  bgcolor=  &gt;&lt;span style= color: #ffffff; &gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td bgcolor=  &gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style= color: #ffffff; &gt;two-umpire mechanics clinic&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style= color: #ffffff; &gt;friday-sunday - &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style= text-align: center;  bgcolor=   width= 10% &gt;&lt;span style= color:  #ffffff; &gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img style= -moz-transform: scalex(-1); -o-transform:  scalex(-1); -webkit-transform: scalex(-1); transform: scalex(-1); filter:  fliph;  src= http://www.clker.com/cliparts/6/k/k/p/5/z/plain-left-white- arrow-md.png  alt=   width= 17  height= 32  /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt; &lt;/table&gt; </code></pre>,html

my navigation drop-down menu won t stay open when on hover -- update fixed  just after posting this i thought i would try adjusting the height of the dropdown button. worked great. here is the change i made for anyone who has a similar problem.    <pre><code>   .dropdownb {         position: relative;

what is the name of this type of control and how can i implement one   this is kind of out there  but i have no idea what this type of control is even called  so i can t look up any examples on how to implement it.    the control has two text areas side by side with arrows in between them. if a user selects a value or multiple values in one text area and then clicks the arrow that points to the other text area  the selected values will jump over to the other text area and be removed from the initial text area.     what is this called,html

html script tag placement   every once in a while i hear about placing html <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags later in the html document rather than in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element.    some people  or so i ve heard  even advocate placing one s scripts as the last few tags before <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code>.    is this due to a performance issue   perhaps loading up a script is a blocking io operation  considering that script-dependent scripts are placed after other scripts like so:   <pre><code>&lt;script src= jquery.js &gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script src= myscriptthatusesjquery.js &gt;&lt;/script&gt; </code></pre>   even if that s the case  why would placing one s scripts near the end of the html document help     thanks!,html

is there any html tag that looks like a <span>  but whose content is defined by its value attribute   i am developing a special-purpose jquery plugin. basically  it divides the contents of a page in a  header  section and a  main  section. the  main  section usually contains grids  and the  header  section usually contains input boxen and dropdowns which are used to filter the contents of the grids. the plugin automates the filtering process by doing the following:   <pre><code>var data = $( #header [id][value] ) .map(function() {     $filter = $(this);     return {name: $this.attr( id )  value: $this.val()}; }); // data will be passed to $.ajax </code></pre>   sometimes  i need that a particular filter in the  header  section be a readonly field. in those cases  i would like to display that field as a regular html label. however  this gets in the way how my plugin extracts the parameters to be passed to <code>$.ajax</code>.    a way to get around this problem would be to do the following:   <pre><code>&lt;div id= header &gt;   ...   &lt;!-- notice the duplicity --&gt;   &lt;input name= hiddenfield  value= hiddenvalue /&gt;hiddenvalue   ... &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>   (code like the preceding snippet is not actually present in my html files. it is just the html representation of the dom elements generated by my plugin.)    but i want a better solution  one that does not involve duplicating data. so  is there any  html tag that looks like a <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>  but whose content is defined by its <code>value</code> attribute,html

some borders thicker in html table  i use html tables to display datasets in my web applications. i know that is better use divs  but at the moment i can t change all old applications.    so my question is about the border in html tables. even using css to style it  some borders (not all) are thicker than others  usually when there are 2 borders at the same place   for instance between columns.    here is an example how my table is rendered ; note some lines are thicker than others : s24.postimg.org/t96yn5m5h/example.jpg     is there a way to avoid this ugly effect      thanks !,html

can a large div not trigger browser scroll bars   i have a large div housing my background image.  generally  it will be centered with the sides going off the screen.  because it is background  i don t want scrollbars to show up on the browser- is there a solution here     thanks    <strong>edit:</strong> let me clarify based on the answers:    i have a large image that extends beyond the browser s boundaries  but that i need to assign to a div background or img instead of the body background because i m manipulating it w jquery  etc.   <ul> <li>i know it is <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4056410/can-background-image-extend-beyond-divs-borders >not possible for a div s background image to extend beyond its borders</a>.  </li> <li>i also can t use an img or nested div with overflow:hidden because that would hide the overflow  when all i want is for it to not trigger scrolls  i.e. be ignored physically by layout engine but still be shown visually  just like an overflowing body background would.</li> </ul>,html

how do i prevent unnecessary resource-load when i create new html elements   update:    finally  i guess i was asking a stupid question. the jquery creates dom elements and it will be requested anyway. so i think it s better to use <code>.html(xxx)</code> to implement the feature rather than using <code>$()</code> to create anything before.   <hr>   this is quite tricky and i never realize it before. but today i realized it s very important to a web project.    say i have two images created dynamically:   <pre><code>var $img1 = $( &lt;img&gt; ); $img1.attr( src    http://domain.com/1.png );  var $img2 = $( &lt;img&gt; ); $img2.attr( src    http://domain.com/2.png ); </code></pre>   right after the browser runs the code above  the two images would be requested. that would be a waste of the client s and the server-side traffic.    is it possible for me to control when the resource request be sent     my expectation is not to do it by assigning <code>src</code> later because in my case it d be much more complicated  the html code is containing a lot of stuff rather than some <code>img</code> tags. for example  is it possible to tell the browser that  please wait until the img tag is added onto the dom tree,html

using extended find and replace + reg expressions to find and remove an anchor tag in html  i m trying to use regular expressions to find and remove all anchor tags identical to these -   <pre><code>&lt;a href= mms://media.domain.com/che/filename-1.wma &gt;title name&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;a href= mms://media.domain.com/che/filename.wma &gt;title name part ii&lt;/a&gt; </code></pre>   where only the filename and titles change  and i need to leave the title (unlinked) behind.    because of my word-processing background i naively tried the following wildcards in my extended find and replace with regular expressions checked:   <pre><code>&lt;a href= mms://media.domain.com/che/*.wma &gt;*&lt;/a&gt;     </code></pre>   it does not work of course  not even to remove the entire link and text.      after much searching and reading i m still just guessing at how to do this.   since no example i ve found does exactly what i need using extended find and replace.  all of this is over my head.    i have searched  how to use regular expressions in search and replace  with homesite  dreamweaver  topsite and other similar software to what i m using to edit my html docs. without success. i ve read several tutorials on using regexp and i m learning  but still cannot seem to do what i need. i have read how to use regexp in php  perl  c++ but cannot transition this over to what i need.     i m willing to use other text editing software to accomplish this as i need to remove about 4 000 of these wma file links  while leaving the titles and other tags untouched.    i have searched similar questions here on stackoverflow.  and read up on using regular expressions in general  but i cannot follow what is explained enough to adapt it to what i need.  this is such a big subject.    this is what i have so far:   <pre><code>&lt;a href= mms:\/\/media\.domain\.com\/cme\/           \.wma &gt;       &lt;\/a&gt;   </code></pre>   the parts where i ve left spaces are what s giving me trouble.    thanks,html

how would i go about ignoring certain code in a html file  from another html file   this may seem like an unconventional thing to ask  but i was wondering if it is possible to alter certain code (e.g. <code>&lt;title&gt;blah blah blah&lt;/title&gt;</code> in file1.html  from file2.html  i want to ignore/cancel out that code from file2.html. i know you would just open up file1.html and use <code>&lt;!--&lt;title&gt;blah blah blah&lt;/title&gt;--&gt;</code> to hide that  but is that possible to do from file2.html  this is just purely a hypothetical question.    thanks,html

anchor links just won t work  i am working on a bespoke wordpress build and for some reason  i just cannot get some anchor links to work. it s driving me potty and i just don t know what the problem is.    i have discovered  static anchor links are working fine (the back to top button works). however  i am using advanced custom fields to generate id s for the anchor tags. the ids are generating correctly  but won t work as anchor tags.    anyone have any ideas  the bit i am referring to is the service boxes near the bottom of the page. the idea being you click on these and that they will take you to the services page  and down to the relevant section.    the markup i am using is:   <pre><code>&lt;ul class= cf &gt;     &lt;li&gt;         &lt;div&gt;             &lt;a href= /services/#dimensional-surveys &gt;                 &lt;div class= filter &gt;&lt;/div&gt;                 &lt;img width= 500  height= 600  src= pexels-photo-175771-500x600.jpeg  class= attachment-feature size-feature  alt=   /&gt;                                                        &lt;h3&gt;3d dimensional surveys&lt;/h3&gt;             &lt;/a&gt;         &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;ul class= service-list cf &gt;     &lt;li id= #dimensional-surveys &gt;         &lt;div class= feature  style= background-image:url(pexels-photo-175771.jpeg); &gt;         &lt;/div&gt;      &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; </code></pre>,html

html - split src attribute over multiple lines  so i have a html element that looks something like     <pre><code>&lt;element src= http://lsdjflksjdfkjewiojeriowjekwjekfljsdkfjisdjrsekjfijsiejisjojfsjlfejeileldjfsleisldkjfsiejljefijeljslefifjfsleif &gt; &lt;/element&gt; </code></pre>   see how long that is     i want to break up the src link into multiple lines.    in python you would just use \ to break a long string into multiple lines. in javascript  you just use  +  rest of string  to break it into multiple lines. what is the case for html  the browser wants to interpret my attempt as white space...    so when i did:    <pre><code>&lt;element     src= http://lsdjflksjdfkjewiojeriowjekwjekfljsdkf   jisdjrsekjfijsiejisjojfsjlfejeileldjfsleisldkjfsiejljefi   jeljslefifjfsleif &gt; &lt;/element&gt; </code></pre>   it inserted a bunch of %20 where the line breaks were. what else should i try     on a similar post  the answers suggested on stack overflow that address this issue suggest using javascript to split the lines up  which seems like overkill  and the answer that suggested splitting after  / s in the url seems not to work unless you cram the entire element on the left side of the page which would cause horrible formatting issues... otherwise  it still put spaces in the link.,html

html header the width of text only  headers seem to take up the size of the parent container vs just the size of the text inside of it. so when i do a hover effect it doesn t just happen when over the text but over the width of the container on the same line as the text. i only want to do the hover effect when exactly over the text of the header. below shows a big red bar that is wider than the headers themselves.    <a href= https://jsfiddle.net/1y8n9wuk/  rel= nofollow >https://jsfiddle.net/1y8n9wuk/</a>   <pre><code>&lt;div class= container-fluid &gt;         &lt;div class= row-fluid &gt;             &lt;div class= col-sm-4  id= title &gt;                 &lt;h1&gt;dead anyway&lt;/h1&gt;             &lt;/div&gt;             &lt;div class= col-sm-4 &gt;                 &lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;             &lt;/div&gt;             &lt;div class= col-sm-4  id= menuoptions &gt;                 &lt;!-- testing: list the maps to load --&gt;                 &lt;div class= form-group &gt;                     &lt;label class= control-label  for= maps &gt;maps&lt;/label&gt;                     &lt;select id= maps  class= form-control input-small &gt;                         &lt;option&gt;start.map&lt;/option&gt;                         &lt;option&gt;medium&lt;/option&gt;                         &lt;option&gt;large&lt;/option&gt;                     &lt;/select&gt;                  &lt;/div&gt;                  &lt;h3 style= background-color: red;  id= newgame &gt;new game&lt;/h3&gt;                 &lt;h3 id= savedgame &gt;saved game&lt;/h3&gt;                 &lt;h3 id= options &gt;options&lt;/h3&gt;                 &lt;h3 id= exit &gt;exit&lt;/h3&gt;             &lt;/div&gt;         &lt;/div&gt;         &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>,html

nested   tag auto-closing/opening  i m seeing some weird behavior around nested <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags. see <a href= https://jsbin.com/ripaxe/edit html js output  rel= nofollow noreferrer >this</a> for the test case.    given:   <pre><code>&lt;p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       &lt;p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;           &lt;p&gt;           &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;/p&gt;       &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; </code></pre>   in chrome  this results in   <pre><code>&lt;p&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;     &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;       &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;         &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;           &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;           &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;       &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; </code></pre>   that is  it closes opening tags and opens closing tags. i ve heard (of course) of  self-closing tags ; i ve never heard of  self-opening tags .    ie11 does it a different (and arguably  even wronger) way:   <pre><code>&lt;p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;       &lt;p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;           &lt;p&gt;           &lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;       &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; </code></pre>   so it does not auto-close opening tags  but it does auto-open close tags  resulting in an unbalanced dom tree.    anyway  i m curious what the proper path to address this; should i open issues on chrome and ie bug trackers  i m not particularly well versed in the w3c specs  where would i go to try and find the  correct  behavior (i m not aware of any tags apart from <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> that exhibit this behavior  although i haven t done extensive testing)     for what it s worth  i realize nesting <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags is invalid; this is a result of a third party library that i am working to address with them  i just found this to be bizarre behavior).    edit: i was wrong about ie: see <a href= https://jsbin.com/ripaxe/5/edit html js output  rel= nofollow noreferrer >https://jsbin.com/ripaxe/5/edit html js output</a>. turns out <code>innerhtml</code> is browser dependent. didn t realize that.,html

need div to be populated with images from the bottom up  i m trying to render a div with a set of small icon images laid out horizontally at the <em>bottom</em> of the div.    when the width of the total line of images is less than that of the containing div there isn t a problem.  i m using code like this:   <pre><code>&lt;div class= main-div  style= position: absolute; width: 700px; height: 600px &gt; text text text ...   &lt;div class= icon-tray &gt;     &lt;img src= ... &gt;     &lt;img src= ... &gt;     ...   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>   with the css for  icon-tray  as follows:   <pre><code>div.icon-tray {   position: absolute;   bottom: 0; } </code></pre>   the  main-div  container is positioned with a fixed width and height; there s lots of space between the text at the top and the icons at the bottom.    the css above puts the  icon-tray  div of images all in a line at the bottom of the main div  which is just what i want.    however i ve got a problem when the number of icons won t all fit on just one line.  when that happens the rendered main div looks like this:   <pre> -------------- |text text text ... | | | |x x x x x x x |x x -------------- </pre>   the  icon-tray  div lays out the images line by line starting from the top; whereas i would like the icons to be seen as  filling up  the main div from the bottom upwards  like this:   <pre> ------------- |text text text ... | | | |x x |x x x x x x x -------------- </pre>   i don t have a clue as to how i can go about this.  how can i get the icons to be laid out from the bottom up     thanks for any help!,html

ie: conditional commenting linking to file  all. i m using conditional commenting in ie to fix some css problem that i m having with ie7.    i have a all.css file that work on firefox and ie7 with some execptions that will only fix the ie7 css problem. i put my fix on all_iefixes.css both files is in app_themes/default/ folder.    i use have a master page (default.master) that all my pages inherited. on some page that is inside another folder  for example  localhost/myapp/blah1/blah.aspx will not get the all_iefixes.css in the app_themes/default folder if i change the   <pre><code>&lt;!--[if ie]&gt;&lt;style type= text/css &gt;@import  all_iefixes.css ;&lt;/style&gt;&lt;![endif]--&gt; </code></pre>   to    <pre><code>&lt;!--[if ie]&gt;&lt;style type= text/css &gt;@import  ./../app_themes/default/all_iefixes.css ;&lt;/style&gt;&lt;![endif]--&gt; </code></pre>   then it will work for the page inside the blah1 folder but it will break other page that doesn t live inside blah1 folder.    i think i can create several master page and depend on where i want to put my aspx pages to live then i can adjust the link but i think this is a rather  stupid  fix ( ). is there an elegant way to do this.    jack,html

how to set default value for html drop-down list not from the option element   i m using an adaptation of phpbb to create a drop-down list.    <pre><code>  &lt;select name= destination_path &gt;     &lt;!-- begin path --&gt;     &lt;option value= {path.description} &gt;{path.description}&lt;/option&gt;     &lt;!-- end path --&gt;   &lt;/select&gt; </code></pre>   the list is generated from a mysql query  so it is dynamic. this list is within a form and when the form is fired i want to retain (and return) it s state in session variables. my first thought was to place something in the <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> statement.     i  know you can use:   <pre><code>selected= option_selected   </code></pre>   in the relevant <code>&lt;option&gt;</code>  but it seems like a messy way to do this and would require an if statement to compare each tag as the tag is created.     <em><strong>is there a way to declare the default option in the select tag  or a better defined method to achieve the same result </em></strong>,html

best way to include/update common elements on a small html based site  i know that with a large site you would want to separate footers  menus  etc so that updating that file would push the update out to every page that contains the item.    is the same recommended for a small site made purely in html/css  or is it simpler/easier/standard to code out the menu in each page and update each page when a change is needed     i don t necessarily want to bring in php or etc onto this website  but the ease of updating menus would be nice. any other suggestions  i ve heard server side includes might be one option... is that considered  pure html  or is more required to be set up on the server     thanks!,html

break long url in text editor to 80 characters  keeping it functional and respecting indentation  i code mainly in python  so proper indention is an important issue. i have some html code that contains a very long url. something like this:   <pre><code>&lt;div id= main_content_wrap  class= outer &gt;   &lt;section id= main_content  class= inner &gt;            &lt;p align= justify &gt;     aaa bbb ccc  ddd &lt;a href= http://www.example.com/asaslkdsdfkjsd/fkjsdlfsdlfjsdlf/kjsdlfkj/sldfjslkdfj/skldfjklsdjf &gt;long link&lt;/a&gt; eee.     &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>   if i break that url indenting it to align with the above line (<code>aaa bbb...</code>)  it won t work anymore in the live html since spaces are inserted. the url will thus point to:    <a href= http://www.example.com/asaslkdsdfkjsd/%20%20%20%20fkjsdlfsdlfjsdlf/kjsdlfkj/sldfjslkdfj/skldfjklsdjf  rel= nofollow noreferrer >http://www.example.com/asaslkdsdfkjsd/%20%20%20%20fkjsdlfsdlfjsdlf/kjsdlfkj/sldfjslkdfj/skldfjklsdjf</a>    (notice the inserted string <code>%20%20%20%20</code>). i am forced to break it so that the second line begins at column 1  ie:   <pre><code>&lt;div id= main_content_wrap  class= outer &gt;   &lt;section id= main_content  class= inner &gt;            &lt;p align= justify &gt;     aaa bbb ccc  ddd &lt;a href= http://www.example.com/asaslkdsdfkjsd/ fkjsdlfsdlfjsdlf/kjsdlfkj/sldfjslkdfj/skldfjklsdjf &gt;long link&lt;/a&gt; eee.     &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>   this keeps the url functional  but i don t like it because it does not respect the indentation of the code.    this seems like a rather simple issue  but i haven t found a proper solution.,html

html select option values from mysql db via php are not coming properly inside the tag  i am creating a html form  in which <strong>select</strong> dropdown is used. the values in select are coming from mysql db using php. the problem is  the values from db are not coming inside the select options  but printing outside of it  while i am writing code like this:   <pre><code>$result = mysqli_query($link $sql); if ($result != 0) { echo  &lt;select name= name  &gt; ;      $num_results = mysqli_num_rows($result);     for ($i=0;$i&lt;$num_results;$i++) {         $row = mysqli_fetch_array($result);         $name = $row[ name ];         echo  &lt;option value=   .$name.   &gt;  .$name.  &lt;/option&gt; ;     } echo  &lt;/select&gt; ; } </code></pre>   but when i put one more select  the values comes inside of the select options.   <pre><code>$result = mysqli_query($link $sql); if ($result != 0) { #extra select# echo  &lt;select&gt; ; ############## echo  &lt;select name= name  &gt; ;      $num_results = mysqli_num_rows($result);     for ($i=0;$i&lt;$num_results;$i++) {         $row = mysqli_fetch_array($result);         $name = $row[ name ];         echo  &lt;option value=   .$name.   &gt;  .$name.  &lt;/option&gt; ;     } echo  &lt;/select&gt; ; } </code></pre>   but of-course  there is one <strong>select</strong> box coming for no use. what is wrong in this code,html

repeating row headings in print preview for table / thead doesn t work correctly  i followed this tutorial:    <a href= http://www.terminally-incoherent.com/blog/2009/10/12/repeating-html-table-headers-on-each-printed-page/  rel= nofollow noreferrer >http://www.terminally-incoherent.com/blog/2009/10/12/repeating-html-table-headers-on-each-printed-page/</a>    so i have a table with x number of rows and it has a <code>thead</code> and <code>tbody</code> section.    when i print preview it repeats the headings correctly. but for some reason it introduces a spurious row at the top of the next page:    bottom of page 1:    <a href= https://i.stack.imgur.com/1r1it.jpg  rel= nofollow noreferrer ><img src= https://i.stack.imgur.com/1r1it.jpg  alt= page 1 ></a>    top of page 2:    <a href= https://i.stack.imgur.com/co3te.jpg  rel= nofollow noreferrer ><img src= https://i.stack.imgur.com/co3te.jpg  alt= page 2 ></a>    when i look closely it has actually split that last row. some of it is on one page and the tick is on the other. how do i prevent this     my web content is being displayed in a <code>chtmlview</code> control so needs to be <strong>ie7</strong> compatible.    this improves it:    <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9288802/avoid-page-break-inside-row-of-table >avoid page break inside row of table</a>    but i still get am empty row at the bottom on page 2 now. but overall it is an improvement.   <h1>fiddle</h1>   <a href= https://jsfiddle.net/xs8074th/  rel= nofollow noreferrer >https://jsfiddle.net/xs8074th/</a>,html

how can i keep css rules of tags containing text the same before and after i put them inside <li> tag   i ve difficulties to set up css rules of tags containing text inside <strong>li</strong> tag. anything inside <strong>li</strong> becomes anormaly smaller. to make it readable  i need to make it bigger in an important scale (for instance  from .8em to 1.1 em). unfortunately  the new text s size doesn t always match the one before it was put inside the anchor tag.      what i want is to be able to restore the previous settings as before i place the tag containing the text inside the <strong>li</strong> tag. is there a trick to do that  let s say  for font-size = 12px  do i need to make it  for instance  15px to go back to 12px     <strong>edit</strong>    actually  <strong>a</strong> tag is not causing me trouble  but it s rather <strong>li tag</strong> which shrinks all the  put inside. so  i ve edited the above post by replacing all the <strong>a tag</strong> by <strong>li tag</strong>. i m sorry for that. anyway; while i thought i ve run into an issue  after reading article suggested by s. jones  i m aware of the inheritence property on some tags.    here s the issue. let s say  i have   <pre><code>&lt;a href =  somewhere &gt;somewhere&lt;a&gt; a { font-size: 12px;} </code></pre>   after i put the above tag inside a <strong>li tag</strong>    <pre><code>&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href =  somewhere &gt;somewhere&lt;a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; a { font-size:    ;} </code></pre>   after reading s. jones article  i wonder if i need to disable inheritence or use important!!!      thanks for helping,html

table rowspan and colspan issues  while looking at table structure with rowspan and colspan  i stubbled upon two instances which were interesting.    view <a href= http://jsfiddle.net/hpbds/  rel= nofollow >jsfiddle</a>    the first table should have three rows  but the last row stays in the second row. while i understand that this is fixed if i change the bottom rowspan to 1  instead of 2  why doesn t it work this way    <pre><code>&lt;table border= 1 &gt;     &lt;tr&gt;         &lt;td rowspan= 3 &gt;3&lt;/td&gt;         &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;         &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;         &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;/tr&gt;     &lt;tr&gt;         &lt;td rowspan= 2 &gt;2&lt;/td&gt;         &lt;td rowspan= 2 &gt;2&lt;/td&gt;         &lt;td rowspan= 2 &gt;2&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;/tr&gt;     &lt;tr&gt;         &lt;td colspan= 4 &gt;bottom&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt; </code></pre>   the second table should have a bottom border  but does not show one. again  i realize the bottom row and the left box would work with a rowspan of 2 for the left side  and a rowspan of 1 for the bottom row  but i was wondering why it doesn t work the way i showed in jsfiddle.   <pre><code>&lt;table border= 1 &gt;     &lt;tr&gt;         &lt;td rowspan= 3 &gt;3&lt;/td&gt;         &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;         &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;         &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;/tr&gt;     &lt;tr&gt;         &lt;td rowspan= 2 &gt;2&lt;/td&gt;         &lt;td rowspan= 2 &gt;2&lt;/td&gt;         &lt;td rowspan= 2 &gt;2&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt; </code></pre>,html

prevent popup from being closed on form submit html  i am trying to prevent my popup from being closed when the form is submitted  i tried to do this:   <pre><code>        &lt;form class= popup-form  id= login-popup-form  method= post  onsubmit= return false; &gt;             &lt;label id= login-popup-user-label &gt;your username/email:&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input class= popup-input  id= login-popup-username-field  name= login-username  placeholder= username /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;             &lt;label id= login-popup-pw-label &gt;your password:&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input class= popup-input  id= login-popup-password-field  name= login-password  placeholder= password  type= password /&gt;             &lt;input id= login-popup-submit  type= submit  name= login-submit  value= login /&gt;         &lt;/form&gt; </code></pre>   but that also prevents the values from being sent. so is there a way to make sure the popup doesn t close but also send the values,html
open a local file in browser by just typing a keyword mapped to the file s address  i spent a good amount of time looking but couldn t find an answer. probably not using the right terms to search which is not helping. this is what i want to do: <br><br> 1. i open a browser (specifically interested for ie8 if somebody wants to know). <br> 2. i type <i> game </i>  and nothing else  in the address bar and hit enter. <br> 3. html file <strong>game.html</strong>  which is present on my desktop  opens in my browser. <br><br> can this be done  if yes  how,html
scrolling a div that is sized to the browser window  so first  i know that there are a lot of scrollable div questions  but i did not see one that seemed to address my problem  so bear with me!    here is what i am trying to do:   <ul> <li>i need to display some content in an iframe (it s a report output that i need to embed in my application).</li> <li>i am hosting the iframe in a div.  </li> <li>i want for the div and iframe to size based upon the size of the user s browser window.</li> <li>if the content in the iframe is larger than the div  i want for the div to scroll</li> <li>i can t make the iframe scrollable  because this is really hosted in a larger ui construct -- if the iframe had scrollbars  there could be 2 sets of scrolls in my  real  application (in  real life   i won t have control of the div).</li> </ul>   the problem: i get scrollbars  but a large report is still clipped vertically -- it s as though the scroll does not really take into account the full size of the div.    here is my html:   <pre><code>&lt;div style= width:100%; height:100%; overflow: auto &gt;   &lt;iframe src= a url  style= width:100%; height:100%  scrolling= no &gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>   if i remove the overflow style from the div and make the iframe scrollable  it works  but i can t do that in production  because the host for that iframe really needs to own the scrollbars.,html
how to align two elements on the same line html  i have an example like this <a href= https://jsfiddle.net/5xmeovze/  rel= nofollow >jsfiddle</a> where i have a list of <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element. inside each <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element i have a <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> and a <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>. what i would like to do is i want to align the button on the right  i do this by adding the class <code>pull-right</code> and it worked fine   <pre><code>&lt;button class=  btt pull-right glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right &gt;&lt;/button&gt; </code></pre>     and i want to align the <code>span</code> and the <code>button</code> on the same line  but if i have a very long name inside the span then the button is no longer on the same line with the span. how can i fix this problem,html
html is ignoring valign  so i am building the final page of an online exhibit i am working on.  the final page uses the exact same format as an earlier page in the exhibit (with an image to the left and a paragraph to the right of the image) so i just copy/pasted all the code and changed urls  text  and dimensions of images and td elements as i needed to.  i have changed nothing to do with the alignment of the various elements on the page  but now i have an element that is basically ignoring <em>td valign= top </em> and appears to be aligned to center instead.  i ve done a line by line comparison of the html of the new page with the original but i can t find anything that should have changed it.  basically the text part of the page (<em>title of page</em> and <em>body of page</em>) should start on the same line as the top of the image  but instead it s starting in the center after a huge amount of white space.       here s the particular table in question with the text and full urls removed to make it a bit shorter:    <pre><code>&lt;table width= 917  border= 0 &gt;&lt;/br&gt; &lt;tr&gt;   &lt;td width= 400  valign= top &gt;                     &lt;table width= 10  border= 1  align= center  bordercolor= #8ac3c9 &gt;         &lt;tr&gt;           &lt;td width= 184  bordercolor= #8ac3c9 &gt;&lt;div align= center &gt;&lt;a href= *image*  target= _blank &gt;&lt;img src= *image*  alt= image  width= 400  height= 267  hspace= 1  vspace= 1  border= 0  align= middle &gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;         &lt;/tr&gt;         &lt;tr&gt;           &lt;td bordercolor= #8ac3c9  bgcolor= #8ac3c9 &gt;&lt;div align= center  class= style2 &gt;*image*&lt;/td&gt;         &lt;/tr&gt;       &lt;/table&gt;         &lt;/div&gt;             &lt;/td&gt;   &lt;td width= 500   valign= top &gt;&lt;div align= center &gt;&lt;font size= +2  face= georgia &gt;&lt;b&gt;*title of page*&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/br&gt;   &lt;div align= justify &gt;&lt;font face= georgia &gt;*body of page*     &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;           &lt;/tr&gt;     </code></pre>,html

why is the # convention used in empty anchor tag hrefs   i understand that it s a good idea not to leave empty anchor tags. in jquery and other syntaxes i ve noticed everyone typically uses a # to fill the gap (<code>&lt;a href= # &gt;anchor text&lt;/a&gt;</code>). is this character any better or worse than filling it with anything else  (e.g. <code>&lt;a href= $ &gt;anchor text&lt;/a&gt;</code>). i have no reason to want to do this  but seemingly no reason aside from convention to do it the other way either. why is the <code>#</code> convention used in empty anchor tag hrefs,html

custom ios ui control  sendactions with data  i m trying to build a custom control that you initialize with an array of strings  and then it creates labels one above the other for them that you can click.  i ve got it visually working  but the part about sending actions i m confused about.     <pre><code>internal func sharedinit() {     translatesautoresizingmaskintoconstraints = false      var labels = [uilabel]()     var tagindex = 0     for name in menunames {         let label = uilabel()         label.translatesautoresizingmaskintoconstraints = false         label.text = name         label.textcolor = tintcolor         label.isuserinteractionenabled = true         label.tag = tagindex         addtapgesturerecognizer(label: label)          labels.append(label)         addsubview(label)          tagindex += 1     }     menulabels = labels  internal func addtapgesturerecognizer(label: uilabel) {     let tapgesturerecognizer = uitapgesturerecognizer(target: self  action: #selector(submenuview.handletap(_:)))     label.addgesturerecognizer(tapgesturerecognizer) }  func handletap(_ sender: uitapgesturerecognizer) {     print(sender.view .tag)     sendactions(for: .touchupinside) } </code></pre>   i want the control to be able to have a different action for each of the different labels they pass in when touched.  but i wasn t sure if target-action can do this   when i add an action to the actual control  i have no idea which label is selected right   i think it would work if when i print the tag  i broadcast a notification so the view controller can figure out which label was pressed and then which action to do.  but i wasn t sure if there was a better way to do this with target-action since that s what i see most of the tutorials using for custom controls.  thanks in advance.,ios
frame sizing of tableview within nested child controllers/subviews  i m a bit confused by the proper frame sizing of a table view to fit within my screen.    here s my setup of view controllers within view controllers:   <ul> <li>uitabbarcontroller</li> <li><ul> <li>uinavigationcontroller as one of the tab bar viewcontrollers; title bar hidden</li> </ul></li> <li><ul> <li><ul> <li>viewcontroller - a container view controller because i need the option to place some controls beneath the uitableview  sometimes (but not in the current scenario)</li> </ul></li> </ul></li> <li><ul> <li><ul> <li><ul> <li>uitableviewcontroller</li> </ul></li> </ul></li> </ul></li> </ul>   now  my question is what the proper frame dimensions of the uitableview should be. here s what i ve got in the viewcontroller viewdidload method. i used subtracted 49.0 (the size of the tab bar) from 480.0. however  this leaves a black bar at the bottom. 20.0 appears to do it (coincidentally ) the size of the status bar  but i don t understand why that would be. wouldn t the true pixel dimensions of the tableview be 480-49    <pre><code>// messagetableviewcontroller is my subclass of uitableviewcontroller messagestableviewcontroller *vcmessagestable = [[messagestableviewcontroller alloc] init]; cgrect tableviewframe = cgrectmake(0  0  320.0  480.0 - 49.0); [[vcmessagestable view] setframe:tableviewframe]; self.tableviewcontroller = vcmessagestable; [self addchildviewcontroller:vcmessagestable];  [[self view] addsubview:vcmessagestable.view];         </code></pre>   here s how it looks:    <img src= https://i.imgur.com/1ypik.png  alt= screenshot >,ios

ios how to set wifi network priority programmatically in app   here is our app usage scenario: there are two sections in our app  the first one is that we need load google map  and use google map apis  and the second one is that we need to connect to a personal wifi which can t connect to the public network. so the contradiction is that we can t use these two sections at the same time  if we connect to the personal wifi  we couldn t use google map  and when we disconnect to the wifi  we couldn t use the second section.    does anybody have wonderful idea to solve this problem which has confused us a couple of days.    thanks for any suggestion,ios

how to force one view controller to display in landscape and the other always stay in portrait  i thought this would be simple and i ve read a ton on how to do this  but nothing works for me. i m using xcode 5 and ios7. i have about ten view controllers and i want all of them except one to stay in portrait mode.  i want one of the view controllers to only display in landscape left and then when finished the next or previous view controllers will always revert back to portrait only. i cannot figure out how to do this. any suggestions   i ve read a ton of the stuff posted here  but none of it seems to work for me. thanks,ios
building a flickr app on ipad  i m building an ipad application that needs to display cluster of pictures from flickr.    each cluster (group) can have 10 or 100 pictures. when the app starts  you can see the first 10 clusters (kinda groups of pictures  such as in the  photos  installed application (if you pinch the group  you see the pictures inside it).    now  my question is about performance  and how to retrieve the pictures from flickr. i m considering a subset of 300.000 pictures  with approximately 2389 clusters and obviously i m going to load only what it is needed on the screen.    when the apps start should i load all pictures included in the first 10 visible clusters   (please note that a cluster is represented by a bunch of ids  so the only way to display it is by stacking the included pictures  in the same way the photos application does).    should i use a uitableviewcontroller for this   i have no clue what apis to use  i need some help.    thanks,ios
ios touch reporting frequency  i have a custom uislider subclass that is intended to restrict the rate at which the slider can move.  ideally  i would like this restriction to be in a verbally sensible manner such as  5 units per second .  right now the best i have been able to do is restrict the amount the slider s value can change on a per-update basis.  i could theoretically track the time since the last update was triggered  but if the user doesn t move his/her finger for a short time  then that calculation goes out the window.    in short: is there a way i can get the touch event frequency of the device  so that in the event that the touch events are slower on one device or the other  the rate of change with respect to real time remains constant,ios

custom tableview scroll indicator (ios)  i have an app which uses a tableview  and sometimes there can be as many as 100 items in this tableview.  thus  i have been assigned to customize this scroll indicator  so that it is easy for the user to scroll through their contents. to do this  i need to implement the following:    1) i need the scroll indicator to always show.    2) i need to change the scroll indicator from the ios default gray indicator to an orange one  and add a label in the middle of it which extends inward.  this label will have the date of the cell. as you scroll down in the scroll bar  the date changes to reflect where you are on the page. (see image for clarification).    3) when you click and hold this custom tableview s scroll indicator  it enables fast scrolling.      what is the best way to approach this   should i use a library     <a href= https://i.stack.imgur.com/mj9qe.png  rel= nofollow noreferrer ><img src= https://i.stack.imgur.com/mj9qe.png  alt= enter image description here ></a>,ios

ios: why not use just one view controller for every app  this may sound a bit strange: since there is only one screen visible at a give time why not use a single view controller and regenerate view hierachy/content by allocating adding  destroying subviews programmatically as needed     i m porting a voip sw that runs on a hardware phone. the hw phone has a touch sreen. the touch screens contents are created by a core module that provides instructions to the rendering module displaying these on the touch screen (createscreen createbutton  createtextfield .. destroyscreen  destroybutton ..).naturally  the module managing the screen layout being part of the core voip sw runs on it s own thread. it would therefore be necessary to create/destroy views in the background and push them on the main thread for display. since all the screens/subscreens items are known  i prefer the classic approach (storyboard xib additional code where needed) and match the incoming draw request to the layout items  thus just updating the data. allocating/destroying all these view structures seems a performance nightmare to me as well  but i have been hard pressed to dynamically do it. i need your help in reasoning against it.,ios

use a custom c++ library in a swift ios project  i have a c++ lib as a separate project that i m trying to use in a swift ios app.    the approach i m pursuing right now is:   <ol> <li>compile the lib into .dylib. this happens outside of xcode.</li> <li>in xcode  add the lib to build phases -> link binary with libraries.</li> <li>add the (c compatible) header to bridging-header.h.</li> <li>now  build succeeds but it crashes on simulator (something like  .dylib not found )  because the .dylib is not added to the app package.</li> </ol>   unfortunately i couldn t add the .dylib to  embedded binaries . i guess it must be somehow packaged into a framework (no idea how)     how to make this work  is including the sources into the project a better approach,ios

developing ios for enterprise as individual developer  heyo guys i got a question about the deployment of my app. i am currently doing contracting for a small to medium size business. the app is (as the title suggests) developped for ios.  the app should be for internal use only so putting it on the app store would not be a good idea.  i have read about the enterprise developer program which sounds pretty much like the thing i need except for 2 aspects : 1. 299 per year 2. enterprise apps are intended for really big companies.     is there any other way to distribute the app to the 10+ people working at the business i am currently working for       thanks for your advice    <strong>edit</strong> : thanks for all your answers. i have plans to then further distribute the app to other companies (the app is for driving schools) so that means that there would again be a problem if each of those companies had to buy a licence in order to use my app,ios
when modelling my app can i reuse nsmanagedobject subclass   i think this is a common scenario.  i m defining class models of my app  i will use core data for caching so i would like to take advantage of the nsmanagedobject generated subclass to  reuse  it as a model to pass to different classes. is that advisable  let s say i get some data from the network i want to build an object model with same instance variables as the core data model generated  use it when needed and maybe cache it on the db. what is the common approach there  can i use a category on core data model  core data subclass  encapsulation  new class   thanks for any tips on that.,ios

handling of tableviewcontroller  possible to go to either of two controllers with one being a uiwebviewcontroller  noob at ios development. this is simply a feasibility question. i wanted to see if it was possible to have a tableviewcontroller and  based upon the type of data that is pushed into the cell  have it do a pushviewcontroller between two different controllers.     like say for example  we have locations and people that can be returned as search results and we either want to do a pushviewcontroller with either a profilecontroller or a locationcontroller  would it matter if one of the controllers were a uiwebview     thx      <strong>edit 1</strong> i guess i m looking for a way to say if a tableview cell responds to a particular message similar to this question <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1123485/in-objective-c-given-an-id-how-can-i-tell-what-type-of-object-it-points-to >in objective-c  given an id  how can i tell what type of object it points to </a> and determine which uiviewcontroller to push.,ios

stringbyevaluatingjavascriptfromstring return value is not reliable   i m calling <strong>stringbyevaluatingjavascriptfromstring</strong> while doing an async http get operation in the callback for new bytes arriving.     but i know i don t know for sure  so i m asking. what is the expected behavior      and is <strong>stringbyevaluatingjavascriptfromstring</strong> not executed synchronously  but actually run in a thread  which would be perilous for my purposes and would explain the empty response string... but not the valid response strings     lastly  is there any way to ask uiwebview whether it s busy and therefore cannot run  <strong>stringbyevaluatingjavascriptfromstring</strong> reliably     thanks.,ios

how do i open a uiimagepickercontroller from a presented view controller   <strong>update at bottom of question</strong>    here s what i m looking to do:    main viewcontroller opens a new viewcontroller (i don t want a navigation bar  so do i have to do this modaly ) which then opens the camera.    in the main view controller i have this being called on a button press:   <pre><code>cameraprocessviewcontroller *controller = [[cameraprocessviewcontroller alloc] initwithnibname:@ cameraprocessviewcontroller  bundle:nil];  [self presentmodalviewcontroller:controller animated:no]; </code></pre>   which opens up the next controller.  in that next controller in the viewdidload method i have:   <pre><code>if([uiimagepickercontroller issourcetypeavailable:uiimagepickercontrollersourcetypecamera]) {      uiimagepickercontroller *imagepicker = [[uiimagepickercontroller alloc] init];      [imagepicker setsourcetype:uiimagepickercontrollersourcetypecamera];     [imagepicker setdelegate: self];     [imagepicker setallowsediting:no];      [self presentmodalviewcontroller:imagepicker animated:yes];      nslog(@ has camera ); } else {     nslog(@ has no camera ); } </code></pre>   i ve tried both presentmodalviewcontroller and presentviewcontroller and every combination of the two between the main view controller and this child one  however the camera never opens.  when i move the camera code into the main view controller it opens fine.    i ve looked and looked and i can t find anything saying why this would be.    thanks!    <strong>update</strong> i found that in the viewdidload method i can call this:   <pre><code>[self performselector:@selector(opencamera) withobject:nil afterdelay:0]; </code></pre>   and it loads it up just fine.  is this okay or is this not recommended   seems a tad hacky!,ios

identify email id configured in email app in ios device  i have requirement where in my app i can send some data as attachment via email to people in my contact. when the user opens attachment  it opens with the help of my app and saves the data in the receiver s app s database. also actions assigned to that person gets saved in his device s calendar as an event. the problem is that i will be sending the data to multiple recipients and action tasks assigned to everyone  so i need to know the receiving person s identity to save only task assigned to him in his device s calendar as event. now the requirement given to me is when creating action task for each person i also need to save his email-id[as person is selected from contacts stored in that device]  so if i can find the receiver s email id i can identify tasks assigned to only him and save to his calendar.,ios
ios app to ping users like find my iphone  play a sound   i have an idea for an app and have the design created but unsure how to go about doing it programatically.  the idea is simple... ping a silent phone the way  find my phone  can make a silent phone make a sound.  the idea is to have the app read an incoming text message with a command embedded in the text from an  authorized  user.      example: #urgent from my <strong><em>wife</em></strong> would make my phone sound even if it was on silent but #urgent from my <strong>friend</strong> would not cause any action because he is not  authorized  in my app.      from what i have found online  reading text messages in ios is prohibited unless you build your own api/skd (bmw reads the text from the notification center for their idrive function) which will then get rejected by the app store.  is this correct or is there a way to do this      my questions:   <ol> <li>can an app trigger an event by reading text messages with embedded commands like on android </li> <li>in ios is there any way to make a silent phone create a sound at full volume </li> </ol>   i ve found that this is possible for android  but i want to see if it is possible for ios.,ios

how do i detect a dual core cpu on ios   my app uses an <code>nsoperationqueue</code> to cache thumbnail images in a background thread. on the ipad2 i can push the concurrent task count limit up to 5 or 6  but on single core devices like the ipad 1 this brings the ui to a grinding halt.     so  i d like to detect a dual core device (currently only ipad 2) and adapt the concurrent limit appropriately. i know i m not supposed to check model numbers  rather device features. so what device feature should i be looking for that would tell me whether the cpu is dual core,ios

how can i get the default images used in navigation bar   because i want to implement some custom animations in navigation bar i decided to use a custom view instead.    i want it to look exactly like a normal navigation bar though - so i have to use the same back button and  add  image. i have normal navigation bars in other places of the app and there should be no noticeable difference.    can i get these images somehow  if not in the system maybe somewhere in the web  looking for this delivers me a ton of results about how to use custom images in the navigation bar  which is not what i need...    edit: i don t want to have to instantiate a navigation bar and traverse the view hierarchy based on index etc as this is error prone. well i could theoretically do this once for every resolution and save the imgs somewhere... but meh...,ios

nsstring.length crashing after setting string to empty (@  );  i ve created a calculator in ios including each number key as a separate uibutton.    i have an <code>nsstring</code> called calcnumberstring that holds the number being entered into the calculator. this way i can check to see if the max digit amount has been passed and prevent the user from typing anymore.    in my <code>viewdidload</code> event i initialize calcnumberstring like so:   <pre><code>calcnumberstring = [[nsstring alloc] init]; </code></pre>   and when i press a number key (5 for example) the following method fires:   <pre><code>-(ibaction)buttonpressed5 : (id) sender {     if(calcnumberstring.length &lt; 10)     {         calcnumberstring = [calcnumberstring stringbyappendingformat:@ 5 ];         calclabel.text = calcnumberstring;     } } </code></pre>   this works just fine (i can type in up to 10 digits).... until i hit the clear key:   <pre><code>-(ibaction)buttonpressedclear : (id) sender {     calcnumberstring = @  ;     calclabel.text = @ 0  } </code></pre>   it clears as expected  but when i try to press another number key after that i get <code>exc_bad_access</code> or the following <code>nsinvalidargumentexception</code>:   <pre><code>[__nscfset length]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x16c110 </code></pre>   is there something in the <code>buttonpressclear</code> method that i m doing wrong   it s obviously the problem as everything works fine until i clear and then try to type in new digits.    any help would be greatly appreciated.    thank you!,ios

how to obtain carrier profile for ios devices  i am currently experimenting setting up an mvno - i have the sims provided by my host network (from a reseller) and they work as expected on android devices  but ios devices considers my sims as the host network s ones  and installs their profile.    the issue is that some features (personal hotspot) are restricted on their profile based on their customer-facing terms and conditions  which do not apply to me as i am billed for data by the megabyte and am free to use it as i wish. some critical features like volte  wifi calling and visual voicemail do not work at all as i can t tell the device to use my servers instead of the host carrier s.    i ve tried contacting apple developer support who referred me to an irrelevant support article  and there s zero public documentation about this. i ve also gotten in touch with <em>wwwmarcom@apple.com</em> but have yet to receive any reply and it s been 3 days. the reseller can t help and the host network themselves probably wouldn t care unless this is a million-dollar deal which obviously it isn t (at least not yet).,ios

what values should i use for cfbundleversion and cfbundleshortversionstring   this is my first ios app submission and i don t want my app rejected.     this is from the apple docs:    <strong>cfbundleversion</strong> (string - ios  os x) specifies the build version number of the bundle  which identifies an iteration (released or unreleased) of the bundle. the build version number should be a string comprised of three non-negative  period-separated integers with the first integer being greater than zero. the string should only contain numeric (0-9) and period (.) characters. leading zeros are truncated from each integer and will be ignored (that is  1.02.3 is equivalent to 1.2.3). this key is not localizable.    <strong>cfbundleshortversionstring</strong> (string - ios  os x) specifies the release version number of the bundle  which identifies a released iteration of the app. the release version number is a string comprised of three period-separated integers. the first integer represents major revisions to the app  such as revisions that implement new features or major changes. the second integer denotes revisions that implement less prominent features. the third integer represents maintenance releases.    the value for this key differs from the value for “cfbundleversion ” which identifies an iteration (released or unreleased) of the app. this key can be localized by including it in your infoplist.strings files.    but it seems a bit strange. my interpretation for this is to put both values the same  i.e.:   <pre><code>cfbundleversion: 1.0.0 cfbundleshortversionstring: 1.0.0 </code></pre>   can someone confirm 100% that is what i am supposed to put,ios

pass touch to another view controller (ios)  i have a long press gesture which presents another controller.  in the presented controller  i have touchesbegan()  touchesmoved()  and touchedended() methods which detect touching on the view controller.    when i long press  and hold down  the next view controller is presented. if i do not release the long press  and move my finger on the screen  the touchesmoved() method does not get called  and when i stop touching  the touchesended() is not called.  however  when i release the long press touch  and touch it again  these methods will be called  since the long press gesture recognizer is no longer receiving the touch  and rather the presented view controller receives the touches.    is there anyway for the presented screen to recognize the touches  while still pressing the long press   how do i pass this long press recognizer to the next view controller,ios

why is setting the window s rvc taking about 4 seconds   i m stepping though the code interactively in xcode of my didfinishlaunchingwithoptions: method and have noticed that it is pausing for about 4 seconds at the last line in this pseudo code:   <pre><code>- (bool)application:(uiapplication *)application didfinishlaunchingwithoptions:(nsdictionary *)launchoptions {    ...  create and initialize model  ... create uiviewcontroller create navcontroller with view controller  self.window.rootviewcontroller = navcontroller; </code></pre>   where navcontroller is as its name implies a uinavigationcontroller.    why is it pausing at this particular line when stepping through using xcode     i m initializing my model in didfinishlaunchingwithoptions: and perhaps not coincidentally am testing the behavior when there are quite a lot of data objects for the model to scan upon creation (its scanning files  reading them and creating objects  so likely to be slow when there s lots of files). at the moment the model initialization is synchronous and  i m seeing how long it takes to determine if it should become asynchronous and that s when i noticed this behavior.    if its the model which is taking time to construct and that is why i m seeing the delay in the ide then why is this delay manifesting when the rootviewcontroller is being set and not when the model is constructed     to clarify what my question is:   <ul> <li> i m not asking why is my code slow </li> <li> i m not asking how to track down the location of slow code </li> <li> what i am asking  merely because i am curious  is why if my model initialization is slow does it manifest when interactively stepping through the code in the debugger at the assignment to the window s rvc. </li> </ul>,ios

ios: viewcontroller title reverts back to original  i m experiencing some issues with customizing the navigation bar items (title  custom bar buttons) for view controllers provided by ios  such as abpersonviewcontroller and ekeventviewcontroller  where my custom items disappear and the originals come back.    in the following example  i have a subclass of abpersonviewcontroller which has a custom title  my title! :   <pre><code>- (void)viewdidload {     [super viewdidload];     self.title = @ my title! ; } </code></pre>   <img src= https://i.stack.imgur.com/kkxeq.png  alt=  >    the title appears as expected  but after interacting with this view controller for a while (such as clicking edit to edit the contact info and pressing done  or even scrolling the view up and down multiple times) the title reverts back to the original  info . how can i ensure that this doesn t happen     this is happening on ios 6.x and occurs with custom buttons i added on the navigation bar as well. thanks in advance.,ios
manual rotation  i have rather complicated user interface for my application that supports both portrait &amp; landscape orientations (excluding portraitupsidedown). there are two view controllers and thus two views. the first one represents portrait ui and the other landscape. both controllers are related with the same class. i have created two outlets for each kind of orientation and several outlet collections for other ui objects. the code that i use for animating the rotation is below.     this is how i declare those properties.   <pre><code>@property (strong  nonatomic) iboutlet uiview *landscape; @property (strong  nonatomic) iboutlet uiview *portrait; </code></pre>   and the process of animation.    <pre><code>- (void)willanimaterotationtointerfaceorientation:(uiinterfaceorientation)tointerfaceorientation duration:(nstimeinterval)duration {     if(tointerfaceorientation == uiinterfaceorientationportrait) {         self.view = self.portrait;         self.view.transform = cgaffinetransformidentity;         self.view.transform = cgaffinetransformmakerotation(degreestoradius(0));         self.view.bounds = cgrectmake(0.0  0.0  320.0  568.0);     } else if(tointerfaceorientation == uiinterfaceorientationlandscapeleft) {         self.view = self.landscape;         self.view.transform = cgaffinetransformidentity;         self.view.transform = cgaffinetransformmakerotation(degreestoradius(-90));         self.view.bounds = cgrectmake(0.0  0.0  568.0  300.0);     } else if(tointerfaceorientation == uiinterfaceorientationlandscaperight) {         self.view = self.landscape;         self.view.transform = cgaffinetransformidentity;         self.view.transform = cgaffinetransformmakerotation(degreestoradius(90));         self.view.bounds = cgrectmake(0.0  0.0  568.0  300.0);     } } </code></pre>   the problem is being that the second (landscape) view doesn t exist neither at the moment of rotation nor at the moment of view s loading. code samples that i use as an example don t work for me due to this issue. as well as i understand the thing  the second view isn t automatically loaded and i should do something about that in my viewcontroller...     please help me solve that problem! thank you in advance!    p.s. everything works fine with using a simple .xib file for managing ui. i just simply drag two views and it s okay because they are both handled by the same controller. so what do i do for my storyboard,ios

ui structure design (tab bars)  i ve got a question connected with designing app with <em>tab bars</em>.    lets assume we have a relatively complex app with <em>many</em> <code>uiviewcontrollers</code> which are embedded in a <code>uinavigationcontroller</code>. all these controllers should also display bottom bar composed of 2 navigating buttons + centered app logo. <br> i suppose i should avoid <code>uitabbarcontroller</code> in such case     is it a good idea/pattern to create some base <code>tabbedviewcontroller</code> which extends uiviewcontroller and consists of uitabbar that would be an outlet and would be configured in this base controller s <code>viewdidload()</code>  <br> the only drawback i see is when a new controller in <code>storyboard</code> is being added you d need to manually add an empty <code>uitabbar</code> and connect it with base s outlet.    is it the best way to solve it,ios

crop to face with face detection  i m modifying the apple squarecam example face detection app so that it crops the face out before writing to the camera roll instead of drawing the red square around the face. i m using the same cgrect to do the cropping as was used for drawing the red square. however the behavior is different. in portrait mode  if the face is in the horizontal center of the screen  it crops the face as expected (the same place the red square would have been). if the face is off to the left or right  the crop seems to always be taken from the middle of the screen instead of where the red square would have been.    here is apples original code:   <pre><code>- (cgimageref)newsquareoverlayedimageforfeatures:(nsarray *)features                                              incgimage:(cgimageref)backgroundimage                                        withorientation:(uideviceorientation)orientation                                            frontfacing:(bool)isfrontfacing {     cgimageref returnimage = null;

why is delete called edit on ios  and why is it hold to delete for an app   one of the most confusing things i find out ios is the concept of the  edit  button turning on some special  delete  mode in apps  this seems like the standard from the ui guidelines. why doesn t ios apply this same use pattern when uninstalling an app from the device  instead for an app uninstall it is  hold to delete.  what is the reasoning behind these two different patterns that accomplish the same thing  but aren t applied consistently  more importantly  what is the proper way to implement the delete ui pattern on an ios app,ios

ios 9 and 10 - app can t be started after a while since installation  after a while – which might have been a few weeks or months earlier  but now is more like hours or sometimes even minutes – i can no longer launch the app. all i get is one or a few sessions of app working normally after the installation  then it gets into this state and i can t do anything with it except for delete and reinstall. when i tap the app icon  i get a black screen for 15-25 seconds  then the app crashes.    here is an excerpt from the log i got via xcode  and more logs are attached:   <blockquote>    fatal error generating launch image for com.my.app.name:   error domain=uilaunchstoryboarderrordomain code=2  error loading:   [ setvalue:forundefinedkey:]: this class is not   key value coding-compliant for the key delegate.    userinfo={uilaunchstoryboardclientbundleidentifier=com.axialexchange.ah-newton    nslocalizeddescription=error loading: [   setvalue:forundefinedkey:]: this class is not key value   coding-compliant for the key delegate.}  </blockquote>   observations: when viewing it in the list of recent apps (i.e. double-press the home button)  the app looks fine  and i ve seen different screens in different apps there  so it doesn t look like it matters what screen i left the app on. reproducible on iphone 5 / ios 10.1.1 and ipad 2 / ios 9.3.5. never seen it on iphone 5s /ios 8.4.1. restarting the device doesn t help.,ios
tabbarcontroller in objective c  i have an application which uses tabbarcontroller. it has two tabs- tab a and tab b. the tabs are mapped to view controllers through navigationcontroller. the mapping goes like this. tab a-> navigation controllera->tableviewcontrollera. tab b->navigation controllerb->tableviewcontrollerb. tableviewcontrollera-> links to-> tableviewcontroller b. tableviewcontroller b->links to -> detail screen. the problem is when i click the tab a it takes me to relevant view. then i click tab b and it takes me to correct view and then to its detail. but when i click the tab a again the view loaded remains there. i have to click tab a again to load the tableviewcontrollera.,ios

uisearchbar and uinavigationbar from navigation controller disappearing when searching  i have a uinavigationcontroller with a uisearchbar right under the uinavigationbar. when i click in the search bar  the text and buttons on the uinavigationbar disappears  but the blank white bar still stays. i think this is because it is a navigation controller and so the navigation bar can disappear. in addition  when i start typing  the search bar disappears  but i can still type. my question: is there a way to either make the entire navigation bar disappear when i start searching or make the text on the navigation bar stay while searching  and how do i ensure the search bar does not disappear  thanks.<img src= https://i.stack.imgur.com/5n4wq.png  alt= before i start typing >    <img src= https://i.stack.imgur.com/qmah0.png  alt= when i start typing >,ios

is it possible to easily display a view that stays visible as view controllers change   i have a requirement to display a thin status-bar-like view below the navigation bar that slides into view and remains visible for several seconds before sliding back out of sight when certain actions occur.    i could do this easily enough for any given view controller by animating its frame as appropriate when it needs to appear/disappear.    however i have a few different view controllers and i don t want to duplicate the same code for managing the appearance of the bar in each controller. besides duplication of code i suspect there ll be flicker when navigating between controllers if the bar is currently meant to be visible at the time of changing controllers.    what are options for approaching this problem,ios
how should an address book be made a property of a class   i have a class that accesses the address book  if i have the following code then i get warnings from the analyzer  one is for a leak in the init method and another is saying the class doesn t own the object when its releasing it in the dealloc.    i presume the 2nd warning is due to declaring the address book ref as assign  but its not possible to make it strong as this generates a compilation warning. what is the correct way of dealing with the address book as a property    <pre><code>@property (assign  nonatomic)   abaddressbookref                addressbook;  .. - (id) init {     self = [super init];     if (self)     {         if (abaddressbookcreatewithoptions)         {             // ios 6 onwards             self.addressbook = abaddressbookcreatewithoptions(null  null);         }         else         {             // &lt; ios 6             self.addressbook = abaddressbookcreate();         }     }     return self; }   - (void) dealloc {     if (self.addressbook)     {         cfrelease(self.addressbook);     } } </code></pre>,ios

uiscrollview inner boundaries issue  so i have a strange bug in my code that is confusing me... in the screenshot below  i have a uiscrollview. in the storyboard  i set the background color to red. then using a bit of code  i set the boundaries so that there is a tiny gap between the title bar area and footer (the yellow slivers).    the problem is that when i scroll the scroll view <em>all</em> the  bottom   the scroll bar is not actually at the bottom of the uiscrollviews boundaries. this behavior is also mirrored when you scroll all the way to the top of the scrollview  and so it adds an ugly space to the top of the scrollview.    is there some sort of separate bounds that i should set for the inner size of the scrollview     <img src= https://i.stack.imgur.com/ihdnl.png  alt= screenshot > code:   <pre><code>cgfloat navbarheight = self.navigationcontroller.navigationbar.frame.size.height; cgrect screenrect = [[uiscreen mainscreen] bounds];  self.productscrollview.frame = cgrectmake(0  navbarheight+22  screenrect.size.height  screenrect.size.width-footerheight-navbarheight-23);     self.productscrollview.contentsize = cgsizemake(self.productscrollview.frame.size.height  self.productscrollview.frame.size.width); self.productscrollview.contentsize =cgsizemake(screenrect.size.width  700); </code></pre>,ios

2 different view types  one app  i have been working on an app for ipad with two different view types  half of it utilizes viewbased to connect to a server over a wireless network.  the other half utilizes a split view controller to show core data retreaved from the server.  i have been working on the two different parts independently to insure that i could understand how each worked.  i m having trouble jumping between the two views. the question of the day for me is  is it even possible to combine two different sets of views,ios

view dismissing itself on touch without any code  i have a series of view controllers that are navigated by  back  and  next  uibarbuttonitems*. the problem i have is the view controllers dismiss when the view is touched anywhere in the top half of the view without any code whatsoever.     nothing is calling <strong>[self dismissviewcontrolleranimated:yes completion:nil];</strong> i didn t notice this behavior until after i updated to xcode 6.3.1  i can t even think of a way to capture the event with nslog.     i have commented out everything but the view still dismisses when i touch  it. i ve never been stumped like this. <strong>any suggestions</strong>    <pre><code>- (void)viewdidload {     [super viewdidload];   //  uiswipegesturerecognizer *swipeleft = [[uiswipegesturerecognizer alloc] initwithtarget:self action:@selector(actnext:)];   //  swipeleft.direction = uiswipegesturerecognizerdirectionleft;   //  [self.view addgesturerecognizer:swipeleft];   //   uiswipegesturerecognizer *swiperight = [[uiswipegesturerecognizer alloc] initwithtarget:self action:@selector(actback:)];  //   swiperight.direction = uiswipegesturerecognizerdirectionright;  //  [self.view addgesturerecognizer:swiperight];  }  - (void)didreceivememorywarning {     [super didreceivememorywarning];     // dispose of any resources that can be recreated. } -(ibaction)actnext:(id)sender {     //pagethree *p3 = [[pagethree alloc] initwithnibname:@ pagethree  bundle:nil];     //[p3 setmodaltransitionstyle:uimodaltransitionstylepartialcurl];     //[self presentviewcontroller:p3 animated:yes completion:nil]; }   -(ibaction)actback:(id)sender {      nslog (@ dismiss invoked );    // [self dismissviewcontrolleranimated:yes completion:nil]; }  @end </code></pre>,ios

hardware-accelerated scaling on ios without opengl  i m currently writing an ios backend for a cross-platform program whose platform-independent engine writes all of its graphics into 32-bit pixel buffers  in rgba order. the alpha byte isn t used. the graphics are always opaque so i don t need alpha blending.    what is the most efficient option to draw and scale these pixel buffers to my <code>cgcontextref</code> inside my <code>drawrect</code> method  the pixel buffers are usually only 320x240 pixels and need to be scaled to completely fill my view s dimensions  e.g. 1024x768 on non-retina ipads and 2048x1536 on retina ipads. this is a whole lot of work so it s best done using the gpu. but how can i force ios to draw and scale using the gpu without using opengl     i ve tried using <code>cgcontextdrawimage()</code> but this is really slow  probably because everything is done using the cpu.    i ve also had a look at the <code>ciimage</code> apis because these are apparently gpu optimized but the problem is that <code>ciimage</code> objects are immutable so i d have to constantly create new <code>ciimage</code> objects for each frame i need to draw which will probably kill the performance as well.    i could go with opengl of course but i d like to get some feedback on whether there is an easier solution to get what i want here.     thanks for any ideas!,ios
add private key to production certificate for ios  the account owner has a production certificate that when i download and open shows in my key chain under  certificates  but not under  my certificates.   therefore i cannot resign the .ipa.  also  it does not have my private key attached to it.     how do i add my private key to it   this is for an in house app distribution and i do not have the permissions to create a new  production certification  which should not be needed anyway.    every thing is fine when i use a  development certificate.,ios

ios swift using image.xcassets vs dropping image in xcode folder  in the last 6 months i have been able to make a pretty good app in ios swift. but now i want to touch upon some performance and best practices in development.     so i wanted to know what is the best practice of using images in xcode  to be specific  i usually drag and drop images in my project folder to use it inside my app. but i know that we can also use image.xcassets to do the same thing.     the question is  which one is the right way  or which one should be used when      i have seen in image.xcassets we have to provide 3 images. 1x  2x and 3x. does that mean that i am increasing the size of the app (considering i am using many images)  also how does it effect the performance  is there any difference in fetching the file from project folder or from image.xcassets,ios

ios gesturerecognizers all directions  i am fairly new to ios development. i have just started about a month or two ago. i have an idea for an application  but it would require gesture recognizers. i have looked for the documentation for gesture recognizers but as far as i can tell  it can only detect 4 directions. up  left  right  and down. is there anyway to write some code that will let you detect any direction the user swipes. for example  if the user were to swipe towards the upper-right direction or bottom-right direction  is there a way to detect that     edit: after thinking about this i have come up with a better way to explain what i need code for. if i was developing a game for ios and the user is usually in a camera view (birds-eye view) and i wanted to allow them to move their view in a map so that they could perhaps view an enemy s base or their ally s base  how would i detect those diagonal swipes rather than just up  right  left  and down swipes,ios

strange drop shadow appears on my programmatically drawn view  i can t explain it  but my programmatically drawn views suddenly have drop shadows. it was working as it should  but somewhere along the line  it stopped. the code that i was editing doesn t even run before this bug.    i ve tried to research  but unfortunately  too many people want to add a drop shadow.    update: it is due to something that happens when dragging/moving the view (as it happens when entering the view through the right menu  but not otherwise). i haven t solved it yet.    <img src= https://i.stack.imgur.com/jyxw4.png  alt= enter image description here >,ios
nsmutablearray or nsmutabledictionary : which is best for this scenario   i need to scroll through several thousands of words to categorize them... to determine which words have the same pattern. (this part works) for example  a four letter word that has two m s in 2nd &amp; 4th position represent a pattern ( -m-m ).  once i have gone through all the words  i will know how many words there are for any given pattern.  i am scrolling through now  but the problem i have is  remembering  how many words i have in any given pattern.    i was thinking of using nsmutabledictionary and have the key be the pattern ( -m-m- ) and the object represent the count of that pattern.  this means every time i come across a pattern  i look up that pattern in the dictionary  get the key  increment the key  and put it back in the dictionary.    i need help with both the decision and syntax for performing this task.    thank you,ios

best way to share data between parent-child controllers in my case  (not sure if i need delegation or shared data state)  i currently have a controller  eventviewcontroller which users access to either create or view events.     during init  my eventviewcontroller will set isnewevent depending on whether an event has been passed to init.    i have decided to create a separate view controller  videoeventcontroller handles the video recording functionality for the event. hence the relationship between eventvc and videovc is essentially parent-child.    videovc needs to access isnewevent and possible other variables from the parent controller.     will it be better to perform dependency injection via prepareforsegue (meaning i will set isnewevent and other variables that the videovc will require to the videovc) or can i simply use parentviewcontroller,ios

calling self inside a block for an asynchronous rest request  i m having trouble calling <code>[self userloggedin]</code> when it is within the <code>withblock</code> block. it gets called but it doesn t show the tithomeviewcontroller. if i move it below and outside the block then it works correctly. obviously though  i want it to be called from within <code>withblock</code> as that is the completion handler for an asynchronous rest request.   <pre><code>- (void)doauth {     // call the facebook api /me method     [fbrequestconnection startformewithcompletionhandler:      ^(fbrequestconnection *connection  id result  nserror *error)      {          // populate global facebook user info          self.fbaccesstoken = [[[fbsession activesession] accesstokendata] accesstoken];          self.fbuserid = [result objectforkey:@ id ];           // authenticate with the titter api          [self callapi:@ auth  withblock:^(nsdictionary *jsondata) {              nsstring *_id = [jsondata objectforkey:@ _id ];              if (_id != nil) {                  self.userid = _id;                  [self userloggedin];              }          }];      }]; }  - (void)userloggedin {     // display the home view.     self.window.rootviewcontroller = [[tithomeviewcontroller alloc] initwithnibname:@ tithomeviewcontroller  bundle:nil]; }  - (void)callapi:(nsstring *)path withblock:(void (^)(nsdictionary *jsondata))block {     // initialize the api callback url using global root and given path     nsurl *url = [nsurl urlwithstring:[nsstring stringwithformat:@ %@%@   apiroot  path]];      // the titter api requires an authorization header formatted as [userid]@[accesstoken]     nsstring *authorizationheader = [nsstring stringwithformat:@ %@@%@   self.fbuserid  self.fbaccesstoken];      // create the request and add our authorization header     nsmutableurlrequest *restrequest = [[nsmutableurlrequest alloc] initwithurl:url];     [restrequest addvalue:authorizationheader forhttpheaderfield:@ authorization ];      // queue required for calling sendasynchronousrequest     nsoperationqueue *queue = [[nsoperationqueue alloc] init];      // make an asynchronous request to our api and if there is no errors  return formatted json data to the passed block.

load retina (high quality) images programatically (on buttons)  i have a problem that i just haven t been able to figure out. i have an app done that will take a picture from the front and one from the back camera  then merge them together.     the name of the app is <strong>groupcam</strong>    however i have an issue in where my uibuttons will not be loaded as retina images from the start. if i set them as @2x on the interface builder they do appear in high quality but once i reload them programatically the low versions will appear instead.    this is due to the fact that  after a picture is taken and the screen changes the button images change  but when the user presses the back button the camera icons will look horrible (because the low quality versions are being loaded).    please check the following pictures:    <strong>first screen:</strong>　only the upper right button appears distorted because i am checking the value of the camera flash and  loading  the corresponding image programatically.    <img src= https://i.stack.imgur.com/8tqfm.jpg  alt= first screen >    <strong>second screen:</strong>　the user has moved to another screen and came back to the first one  all buttons were reloaded and they now all look distorted.    <img src= https://i.stack.imgur.com/mhd7y.jpg  alt= second screen >    if anyone has any idea of why is this happening i would really appreciate it!    thanks.    edit:    this is how i load the images.   <pre><code>[self.flashbutton setimage:[uiimage imagenamed:@ flashoff ]                            forstate:uicontrolstatenormal]; </code></pre>   i read somewhere on the internet that doing this will automatically load the most suitable version of the image.    i also tried this but the result is the same:   <pre><code>[self.takebutton setimage:[uiimage imagenamed:@ takephoto.png ] forstate:uicontrolstatenormal]; </code></pre>,ios

recording and merging video for screen capture  i am currently grabbing the frames of a video using avplayeritemvideooutput. i use cadisplaylink to grab frames from the output. then i pass the pixel buffer off to the assetwriter. i do it like this:   <pre><code>- (void)displaylinkcallback:(cadisplaylink *)sender {     cmtime outputitemtime = kcmtimeinvalid;      // calculate the nextvsync time which is when the screen will be refreshed next.     cftimeinterval nextvsync = (sender.timestamp + sender.duration);      outputitemtime = [self.videooutput itemtimeforhosttime:nextvsync];     if (self.playerone.playerasset.playable) {         if ([[self videooutput] hasnewpixelbufferforitemtime:outputitemtime] &amp;&amp; self.newsampleready) {             dispatch_async(self.capturesessionqueue  ^{                 cvpixelbufferrelease(self.lastpixelbuffer);                 self.lastpixelbuffer = [self.videooutput copypixelbufferforitemtime:outputitemtime itemtimefordisplay:null];                 cmtime fpstime = cmtimemake(1  24);                 self.currentvideotime = cmtimeadd(self.currentvideotime  fpstime);                 [_assetwriterinputpixelbufferadaptor appendpixelbuffer:self.lastpixelbuffer withpresentationtime:self.currentvideotime];                 self.newsampleready = no;             });         }     } } </code></pre>   this allows me to switch videos real time and keep making a screen recording. but i also want to switch to a split view with two players  grab each of the frames from the players and merge them into a single video. avcomposition would work except that you have to know in advance what tracks and times you want to merge. my screen capture program lets the user switch freely between single and split view and back. is there a way to get the pixel buffer s and use those to merge the recordings into a single video     i have tried doing the following by just taking the first pixel buffer and creating two images  combining them and then creating a new pixel buffer that i pass back to the assetwriter but i just get a black screen video. here s my code for this:   <pre><code>-(cvpixelbufferref)pixelbuffertocgimageref:(cvpixelbufferref)pixelbuffer withsecond:(cvpixelbufferref)pixelbuffer2 {     cicontext *temporarycontext = [cicontext contextwithoptions:nil];      ciimage *ciimage = [ciimage imagewithcvpixelbuffer:pixelbuffer];      uiimage *im1 = [uiimage imagewithciimage:ciimage];      uiimage *im2 = [uiimage imagewithciimage:ciimage];      cgsize newsize = cgsizemake(640  480);      uigraphicsbeginimagecontext( newsize );      [im1 drawinrect:cgrectmake(0 0 newsize.width/2 newsize.height)];      [im2 drawinrect:cgrectmake(newsize.width/2 0 newsize.width/2 newsize.height) blendmode:kcgblendmodenormal alpha:1.0];      uiimage *newimage = uigraphicsgetimagefromcurrentimagecontext();      ciimage *newciimage = [newimage ciimage];      uigraphicsendimagecontext();      cvpixelbufferref pbuff = null;     nsdictionary *options = [nsdictionary dictionarywithobjectsandkeys:                              [nsnumber numberwithbool:yes]  kcvpixelbuffercgimagecompatibilitykey                               [nsnumber numberwithbool:yes]  kcvpixelbuffercgbitmapcontextcompatibilitykey                               nil];     cvreturn status = cvpixelbuffercreate(kcfallocatordefault                                            640                                            480                                            kcvpixelformattype_32argb                                            (__bridge cfdictionaryref)(options)                                            &amp;pbuff);     if (status == kcvreturnsuccess) {         [temporarycontext render:newciimage                  tocvpixelbuffer:pbuff                           bounds:cgrectmake(0  0  640  480)                       colorspace:nil];      } else {         nslog(@ failed create pbuff );     }      return pbuff; } </code></pre>   any suggestions,ios

pass nsdata transactionreceipt with skpaymenttransaction to verify receipts in ios7  so my apologies in advance for the simplicity of this question  i am not a pro with ios  but learning as i go!    i m having a heck of a time figuring out a way to verify receipts properly with my app (a digital magazine). i ve found some <a href= http://vandadnp.wordpress.com/2012/03/19/verify-the-transactionreceipt-of-skpaymenttransaction/  rel= nofollow noreferrer >open source code</a> that looks good and i think will fit perfectly into my app  but i need some help understanding this line in particular:     all you have to do is to pass the nsdata transactionreceipt of an instance of skpaymenttransaction to this class and wait for the response to come back.     what does that look like exactly in terms of code  and in terms of ios7 <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19009268/issue-with-transactionreceipt-deprecated-in-ios-7-warning >now that transactionreceipt is deprecated</a>  at this point i understand the visual code and how to tweak it a lot more than anything else  and that s all i really need to get going. once i understand what that means i can tweak it to make it fit into my app  which is fully functioning and only missing receipt verification. (it already knows when the subscription has been purchased and will unlock accordingly. it just doesn t know when/if that subscription has expired or not.)    the actual source code for receipt verification i m using <a href= http://dl.dropbox.com/u/32143863/iosandosx/sktransactionreceiptverifier.zip  rel= nofollow noreferrer >can be found here</a>. if anyone has anything easier to use i m all ears!,ios

ios  copy  keyword on mutable objects  i ve a theoretical doubt about two type of declaration of a mutable object in ios (and macosx i think) with arc.    what s the difference between a declaration of an nsmutablearray in the class extension  like the code below:   <pre><code>@interface myviewcontroller ()  @property (copy) nsmutablearray* mymutablearray;  @end   //class implementation @implementation myviewcontroller ... - (void)viewdidload {     _mymutablearray = [@[] mutablecopy]; } </code></pre>   and a declaration of the same array in this way   <pre><code>@interface myviewcontroller ()  @property (nonatomic  strong) nsmutablearray* mymutablearray;  @end   //class implementation @implementation myviewcontroller ... - (void)viewdidload {     _mymutablearray = [@[] mutablecopy]; } </code></pre>   which one is better  i ve seen both versions around and apparently both work fine. however i d like to know which one is the best option. i know that the  copy  keyword is to use copy for classes that are part of a class cluster that have mutable/immutable pairs. so in this case  it appear to be the right choice. but the use of the  copy  keyword and the  mutablecopy  property (like the first example) seems a duplicate to me. am i wrong  thanks!,ios

reachability hangs my app when network is too weak  am using reachability api to check network connection before a service request.sometimes when the network is too weak it hangs my app and after some time i get the status.if i switch off my wifi immediately i get the status and when network is proper  then also i get the status instantly but when network is weak(my assumption)its doesn t give the status instantly and as a result gives the user the assumption that the app is freezed and after sometime gives the status that the network is down.how can i tell the user that app is not freezed but it is checking for reachability    <pre><code> internetconnection *ic=[[internetconnection alloc] init];  if([ic connectedtonetwork])  {  //do some request  }  else  {  uialertview *alert=[[uialertview alloc] initwithtitle:@               message:@ network down              delegate:nil                                                             cancelbuttontitle:aglocalizedstring(@ key_ok  nil)                                                 otherbuttontitles:nil];             [alert show]; }   //check internet connection code - (bool) connectedtonetwork{     reachability* reachability = [reachability reachabilitywithhostname:@ google.com ];     networkstatus remotehoststatus = [reachability currentreachabilitystatus];      if(remotehoststatus == notreachable)     {         isinternet =false;     }     else if (remotehoststatus == reachableviawwan)     {         isinternet = true;     }     else if (remotehoststatus == reachableviawifi)     { isinternet = true;      }     return isinternet; } </code></pre>,ios

is it possible to navigate back to the starting point when external links are clicked in a uiwebview   i ve put together a very simple proof of concept app using a uiwebview (and a regular controller) to display a web page. if the web page has external links then when clicked on the app will switch to the web app. however there s no way to get back to my original app.    if i add a navigation controller will i get the ability to navigate back  or is there something else additionally that would be required     (as well as launching web pages it will also be necessary to intercept custom links in the web page and perform some associated action  such as add a contact  in this situation i would also like to be able to navigate back to my app).    tia,ios

updating the correct uitableviewcell in the background after fetching data from a server  my uitableviewcells have a uibutton as their accessoryview. in <code>cellforrowatindexpath</code>  i fetch data from a server in the background using a block. when the block is called  i set the <code>selected</code> property of the button in the cell depending on the data that was retrieved.    when the user scrolls quickly up and down the tableview  some button states are sometimes set incorrectly. i believe this is because the wrong uitableviewcell is being used inside the block (that it is a reused cell instead of the actual cell  which is now probably offscreen).    how do i ensure that the cell inside my block is the cell i want     here s a simplified version of my code that contains the important parts:   <pre><code>- (uitableviewcell *)tableview:(uitableview *)tableview cellforrowatindexpath:(nsindexpath *)indexpath {      //foundusercell is a subclass of uitableviewcell     foundusercell *cell = [tableview dequeuereusablecellwithidentifier:[self cellidentifiertableview:tableview]];          //set the textlabel (this works already)     cell.textlabel = @ something ;      //fetch info from the db that i need to state the state of the button     //thebutton is a property of foundusercell     //thebutton is always set to a foundusercell s accessoryview     [self fetchinbackgroundwithblock:^(int buttonstate) {          //i think that  at this point  cell is sometimes no longer the cell i want                      if(buttonstate == 0)             cell.thebutton.selected = no;         else             cell.thebutton.selected = yes;          //what can i do inside this block to make sure that the cell i m setting is the cell i want      }];      return cell; } </code></pre>   basically  i don t want set the state of the button inside the block if the cell is not the correct cell.,ios

lazy image loading w/ caching  i am not able to form question title because this question is like descriptive.but i can explain clearly here.this is related to image cache in ios.    <strong>my requirement : i want to create one list which contain image view and that image loaded from online. also i need to implement cache for that image (because every time if i loaded fom online it will take too much time and also network consuming).</strong>    <strong>note: generally we are preparing cache key for that image based on that image link.</strong>    <strong>is there any other way to prepare cache key  </strong>    after loading listview i can click on any row and i will redirect to details page. in that detailed page i have edit option and i can change that image. and i resubmit to server. once i complete uploading i force close my application and i open as fresh app. in this case in server side no change in <strong>image link because that image link like <a href= http://www.uigarden.net/english/images/108.jpg  rel= nofollow >http://www.uigarden.net/english/images/108.jpg</a></strong>    now i load that tableview than and all images frying to load from either cache or server. so we have two cases.    1) from cache:     if there is no changing in link and that link id is available in cache folder than it will load from cache. here mu issue : i can not able to find wether it is already edited or not edited. so i can not able to load newly edited image  because i already cached that image based on link.     2) from direct link if that link based key not available in cache .    <strong>how can we distinguish wether it is edit image or old image  </strong>     please help me,ios

ios scroll view bounds not equal to superview bounds  i ve got a uiscrollview that has constraints pinning it to the superview s leading and trailing edges (not the margins).  in this scroll view i have a uiimage which i m setting to initially be the full width of the scroll view.  on the iphone 7 this works correctly  the image is full width    however on the iphone 7 plus there is a gap between the edge of the image and the edge of the screen.  the scroll view is full width as when i zoom the image in it does go right to the edge.    i m getting the image to match the scroll view width by setting    <code> imageview.frame = scrollview.bounds imageview.contentmode = .scaleaspectfill </code>    the issue seems to be the scroll view bounds.  on the iphone 7 plus the scroll view width is reported as 375  however the screen width is reported as 414.  on the iphone 7 the scroll view width is 375 and the screen width is also 375.    anyone know why this is   i m sure i m misunderstanding something!,ios

how do i get a bold version of uifont s prefferedfontfortextstyle   in ios 7  users can manipulate their fonts from the control panel  something designed to help (amongst other things) visually impaired users.    i m trying to work with the new paradign by using the new methods created to support that functionality.  for the most part  it s easy enough -- just use [label setfont:[uifont prefferedfontfortextstyle:uifonttextstyleheadline]] or whatever format you need.    but occasionally i need to adjust those.  for example  maybe headline needs to be a bit bigger.  i can use <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19028107/custom-uifont-for-preferredfontfortextstyle >this</a> answer to that.  unfortunately  i can t figure out how to apply that answer to other changes  such as simply bolding the font without changing the size.,ios

registerdefaults not reflected in settings app  there are a lot of answers surrounding the use of registering user defaults and i have looked hard and am still stumped by the behaviour i am seeing.    in my settings bundle i have one toggle switch which i give the identifier  sharing  give it a default value of yes. i see this toggle switch in the settings app  but it doesn t default to on.  even if i remove the app from the phone and install again.    in my didfinishlaunchingwithoptions method i have the following:   <pre><code>nsuserdefaults *defaults = [nsuserdefaults standarduserdefaults]; nsdictionary *appdefaults = [nsdictionary dictionarywithobject:@ yes  forkey:@ sharing ]; [defaults registerdefaults:appdefaults];  [defaults synchronize]; </code></pre>   if i test to see:   <pre><code>nslog(@ %d  [defaults boolforkey:@ sharing ]); </code></pre>   the default is set  but it is not reflected in the settings app.    if i then go to the settings app and flip the switch to on and test the value:   <pre><code>nsuserdefaults *defaults = [nsuserdefaults standarduserdefaults]; bool enabled = [defaults boolforkey:@ sharing ]; </code></pre>   this will still result in yes which i would expect.    and  then i flip it to off and test again:   <pre><code>nsuserdefaults *defaults = [nsuserdefaults standarduserdefaults]; bool enabled = [defaults boolforkey:@ sharing ]; </code></pre>   it will be no as expected and the connection now works fine.    so  basically everything is working fine except that before the setting is changed  the default exist programatically but it not shown visually in the settings app.    hopefully  someone can point out what i am missing!    thanks,ios

if the user moves an app to the background and then back to the foreground is it permissible for the view to change   my app s main page is a table view and when a row is selected a detailed view is displayed.    there is a requirement that whenever the app moves to the foreground the table view should be displayed  regardless of what view was previously displayed.    the consequence of this is the user may be viewing a detail view  then they switch the app to the background and then immediately back to the foreground again but now their detail view has been replaced by the table view.    i seem to have it in my head that this isn t permissible according to the human interface guidelines  but having a look through that doc i couldn t see anything saying so. so maybe my memory is incorrect. is this behavior permissible by apple  or must the app always endeavor to present the same view it did when the app was last in the foreground,ios

load dynamic functions in ios app  i need to create this app with dynamic functions and screens.     lets say i got 2 types of users for the app - typea and typeb.     if typea user logs in  he will only be presented and allowed to use functiona  and screena     if typeb user logs in  he will be presented with functiona  and screena  plus functionb  and screenb.    when it goes to prod and the app gets installed on the device  it is rarely to happen that 2 types of users will login. it is just typea or typeb.    requirement is if its a typea user that logs in  my app size and memory footprint should only be for functiona  and screena. so by theory the app should be lighter than that of typeb.     im not sure on the term here. but its like the original app will only have functiona  and screena. but it typeb logs in  it will load the other functions and screens dynamically - that is not in the original app.     is this possible,ios

drawrect: how do i do an  inverted clip   i am creating an ios user interface to allow a user to pick a rectangle within an existing image  dragging the corners of that rectangle to the desired size. i now have four custom uibuttons (30% alpha) and a custom view (also with 30% alpha) that draws the dashed lines between the four corner buttons.    to  improve  the interface  i would like my drawrect code to make the cropped portion of the image appear  normal  while everything outside the cropped region is washed out (filled with white color  which will give me the correct effect since the uiview is set to 30% alpha).    the obvious algorithm would be:   <ol> <li>fill the entire image with [uicolor whitecolor] fill</li> <li>draw the four dashed lines with a [uicolor clearcolor] fill</li> </ol>   when i do this  the clear fill isn t showing up. i believe this is because the  fill  of the clear color in step #2 isn t being seen because the pixels were already set to white in step #1. perhaps there s a blend mode that will allow me to see the transparency of the second rectangle  i m not sure about the various blend modes.    my second attempt  which works  does the following:   <ol> <li>draw the four dashed lines with [uicolor clearcolor] fill</li> <li>draw four additional rectangles with [uicolor whitecolor] fill  each representing the portions to the left  right  above  and below the cropped region.</li> </ol>   as i mention  this method works  but seems to me there should be a simpler way instead of me having to calculate these four additional rectangles each and every time.    there is a similar question on so <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5721196/create-layer-mask-with-custom-shaped-hole >create layer mask with custom-shaped hole</a> that uses calayer and masks  but this seems to be overkill for what i need.    does anybody have any suggestions on how to improve this,ios

run block of code that was generated asynchronously   only  when a specific view controller is visible and in control  when my program receives a notification/event (asynchronously) i might need to display an alert.  however  i do not know what view controller will be in control when i receive the notification - i have seen posts that show how to present a alertcontroller at any time regardless of what view controller is on screen. what i  think  i want to do is to defer the display of the alert until a specific view controller is visible.  (the other view controllers are modal and probably should not be interrupted.)  one way  i think i can do this  is to send the blocks to the specified view controller  save them in an array and then requeue them to the main_queue as i transition to the controller (i.e prepareforsegue ) this approach seems kludgy ! any advise,ios
section footer of uitableview is moving when keyboard is appearing  i have a uitableview with different sections in it. each section has its own footer (just a grey line for design reasons). when clicking on a table view cell in a section an alertview and the keyboard appears (to enter a password). but when the keyboard appears the footer of the section is pushed up by the keyboard. u can see it behind the alertview in the grey background. looks very ugly.     how can i avoid that  the footer in the background should stay where it was (on the bottom of the section). any ideas,ios

updating ios application content which include images  i am working on a vegetable gardening application. apart from the vegetable name and description i also have vegetable image. currently  i have all the images in the supported files folder in the xcode project.     but later on i want to update the application dynamically without having the user download a new version. when the user updates the application or downloads new data from the server that data will include the images. can i store those images in the supporting file folder or somewhere where they can be references by just the name.     <strong>related question:</strong>    i will also allow the user to take pictures of their vegetables and then write notes about the vegetables like  just planted    about to harvest  etc. what is the recommended approach for storing pictures/photos. i can always store them in the user s photo library and then store the reference in the local database and then fetch and display the picture using the reference. the problem with that approach might be that if the user accidentally deletes the picture from the library then it will no longer be displayed in my application.     the only way i see if to store the picture in the app local database as a blob.,ios

jquery live mouseleave bug  i know that 99% of the time someone blames a bug on jquery it s their own fault  but i think i might have one.    here s my jsfiddle: <a href= http://jsfiddle.net/ylv5d/2/  rel= nofollow >http://jsfiddle.net/ylv5d/2/</a>    the problem: i have a live handler for  mouseenter mouseleave  which works as expected if i don t have any other handlers  but breaks down when i add another live handler for  mouseout  on another element. unless i m mistaken  these should not interact with each other. however  adding the mouseout event causes the original live handler that is supposed to fire only on mouseenter/mouseleave to instead fire on mouseenter/mouseout.    in my example jsfiddle  there s no way  mouseout  should be printed  right  yet it is when you move your mouse off the blue div.    jquery bug or user error,jquery

how to detect if a check box has been clicked and if it s selected using jquery   i have checkbox which once it s property of clicked is true  i would like to check another checkbox automatically.    i managed to partially get it working by changing the other value of the checkbox to true whenever the other is clicked. but this isn t what i want. i d like to be able to check when the  twofchk  checkbox is clicked and also if the property of checked is true at the same time. how do i do this     jquery:   <pre><code>if ($( #twofchk ).change(function () {             if ($(this).prop( checked   true)) {             alert( it s checked );             $( #confirmemailchk ).prop( checked   true);         }         })); </code></pre>   my question is different  here s why:    i m not just trying to check if a checkbox is checked. i can do that already. i need to detect when the value of checked changes  and if the value of checked is then true. i need to change the checked value of another checkbox is true. again  i am not just trying to check if a checkbox is checked. i need to have an on click of the checkbox and if the checkbox checked value is true  then i need to check another checkbox.,jquery

poeditor.com api usage with jquery  i m using poeditor.com in order to manage the languages of an application i m developping.    poeditor.com gives the possibility to use an api to access some information about the project you have there.    this api needs to be called through a post with next data:   <blockquote>    url:        - <a href= https://poeditor.com/api/  rel= nofollow >https://poeditor.com/api/</a>        arguments:       - api_token (required)       - action = list_languages (required)       - id - the id of project (required)  </blockquote>   what i m trying to do is to call this api through a jquery post query. here is the code i have done:   <pre><code>$(function() {     $.post(          https://poeditor.com/api/           {              api_token  :  ecxxxx28                action     :  list_languages                id         :  1xxx8          }          function(data) {                 alert(data);         }           json      );   }); </code></pre>   using firebug  i can see the query is sent but no answer is sent back by the api. note that i should receive a response in json format.    i don t see what i m doing wrong. does any one could give an example or a tip,jquery
jquery: observe an enumerable/selector  using <code>$( #mytable tr ).live( click   somecallback);</code> (although now deprecated) it is fairly simple to subscribe to the click event for newly added table rows.    i would be interested in a way which doesn t only support events but any jquery commands  something like:   <pre><code>$( mytable tr ).live().attr( hello    world ); </code></pre>   which would add the hello= world  attribute to any newly added table rows. is there any such thing in jquery     <strong>update: please note</strong>. i want to <em>subscribe</em> to the event of an element being added. i do <em>not</em> control the code which adds it. take datatables as a example: the datatables plug-in creates the table rows.,jquery

expanding/collapsing text using jquery  when i want to expand a text i always use this jquery code:   <pre><code>jquery( .readmore ).bind( click   function () {     jquery(this).text(jquery(this).text() ==  leer más     ocultar  :  leer más );     jquery(this).prev().slidetoggle();     }); }); </code></pre>   and html code like the following:   <pre><code>&lt;div class= alwaysdisplay &gt;&lt;b&gt;text to display always&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class= expandtext &gt;text to expand&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class= readmore &gt;leer más&lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>   so  i can display the hidden text clicking on the text  leer más .    my problem is that using this code  the web shows something like:   <pre><code>text to display always  leer más </code></pre>   but i would like to display something like:   <pre><code>text to display always leer más </code></pre>   i mean  the  button  to expand in the same line. i guess that the problem is that when i use a div label  it displays the text in the next line. how could i display the  button  leer más in the same line     thank you very much.,jquery

how to replace all <br /> with \r\n using jquery  i am using <a href= http://jsfiddle.net/terryyounghk/kpegu/  rel= nofollow >this code</a> to save a table as csv (i have altered it a bit to include headers and exclude hidden rows). somewhere line breaks within table cells are lost but i want to retain them as \r\n. there are plenty of similar questions online but i still find jquery a bit mysterious and somehow i haven t been able to find a solution to this hopefully simple problem.   <pre><code>function exporttabletocsv($table  delimiter) {      var $rows = $table.find( tr:visible );      // temporary delimiter characters unlikely to be typed by keyboard     // this is to avoid accidentally splitting the actual contents     var tmpcoldelim = string.fromcharcode(11)  // vertical tab character     tmprowdelim = string.fromcharcode(0)  // null character      // actual delimiter characters for csv format     coldelim =     + delimiter +          rowdelim =   \r\n         // grab text from table into csv formatted string     csv =     + $rows.map(function (i  row) {         var $row = $(row)          $cols = $row.find( td  th );          return $cols.map(function (j  col) {             var $col = $(col)              text = $col.text();              return text.replace(/ /g      ); // escape double quotes          }).get().join(tmpcoldelim);      }).get().join(tmprowdelim)     .split(tmprowdelim).join(rowdelim)     .split(tmpcoldelim).join(coldelim) +           // data uri     csvdata =  data:application/csv;charset=utf-8   + encodeuricomponent(csv);     return csvdata; } </code></pre>,jquery

add a row to the bottom of a table inserting the column header as its content - jquery  i have a jquery mobiile app which has hundreds of tables included within it. i d like to be able to add a new row to the end of each of these tables which would include a cell with a button contained within it with a  data- attribute derived directly from the table header of that table.    i ve managed to add a row  and a  test  value to each but i m completely at a loss as to how to get the column header to display in the bottom cell.   <pre><code>&lt;table&gt;     &lt;tbody&gt;         &lt;tr&gt;             &lt;th&gt;0&lt;/th&gt;             &lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;             &lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;             &lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;         &lt;/tr&gt;         &lt;tr&gt;             &lt;td&gt;michael&lt;/td&gt;             &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;             &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;             &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;         &lt;/tr&gt;         &lt;tr&gt;             &lt;td&gt;jeff&lt;/td&gt;             &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;             &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;             &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;         &lt;/tr&gt;         &lt;tr&gt;             &lt;td&gt;david&lt;/td&gt;             &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;             &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;             &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;         &lt;/tr&gt;         &lt;tr&gt;             &lt;td&gt;juan&lt;/td&gt;             &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;             &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;             &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;         &lt;/tr&gt;     &lt;/tbody&gt; &lt;/table&gt; &lt;/html&gt; </code></pre>   and the script...   <pre><code>$( table ).on( click    td   function() {     var $this = $(this)          name = $this.siblings( :first-child ).text()          pos = $this.index() + 1          num = $this.parent().siblings().first().children( :nth-child( +pos+ ) ).text();             alert(num +   &amp;   + name); });  // appends a row to the bottom of the tables for add to cart button  $( table &gt; tbody:last-child ).append( &lt;tr class= cartrow &gt;&lt;/tr&gt; );  // selects each of the th cells $( table &gt; tbody &gt; tr  ).find( th ).each(function() {     // appends a cell to the row       $( table &gt; tbody &gt; tr:last-child ).append( &lt;td class= cartbutton &gt; . value .  &lt;/td&gt; ); });  // adds the button content to the table cell $( .cartbutton ).append( test ); </code></pre>,jquery
how to make a jquery click event fire only on first click  i have two divs (.basic1 and .basic2). i want .basic1 to fadeout on click  and .basic2 to fade in which i have working wonderfully. the only problem is that once .basic2 fades in  if the user continues to click the link (.navbar1)  it will fade in this div over and over. i know that i need to use the .bind() function  but i can t seem to figure out where in my code to put it. thanks!   <pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {     $( .navbar1 ).click(function(e){         e.preventdefault();          $( .basic2 ).hide().load( .basic2   function() {             $(this).delay(600).fadein(1000);             $( .basic1 ).fadeout(1000);         });     }); }); </code></pre>,jquery

removing all matching classes in jquery  hi i have an li element that will have something along the lines of this for a declaration   <pre><code>&lt;li class= module ui-helper-fix &gt; </code></pre>   and i can dynamically change the color of the module by adding on classes (that are provided dynamically through db calls) the end result being    <pre><code>&lt;li class= module ui-helper-fix module-green &gt; </code></pre>   or   <pre><code>&lt;li class= module ui-helper-fix module-default &gt;  </code></pre>   well i am fine with changing the color by adding on a new module-whatever class but what i would like to do is remove any class that matches module-xxxx so it starts with a clean slate and then add on the class module-crimson.    so how do i remove all classes that match module-xxx first   keeping in mind i don t want to remove the base module class.    edit:    i basically need the method of doing a clean sweep on any module-  class:    before execution   <pre><code>&lt;li class= module ui-helper-fix module-default &gt; </code></pre>   after clean sweep   <pre><code>&lt;li class= module ui-helper-fix &gt; </code></pre>   then add class and final result   <pre><code>&lt;li class= module ui-helper-fix module-green &gt; </code></pre>   thanks.    -seth,jquery

display controls on scroll  is there an easy way to show a pane at the bottom of the page  when the user scrolls down beyond half the page and hides it when they scroll up. they should also be able to close it if they do not want to see it again  ever.    this is what i have tried so far:   <pre><code>$(window).scroll(function() {         if($(this).scrolltop() &gt; 200) {             $( #note ).fadein();         } else {             $( #note ).fadeout();         } });  $( #note ).click(function() {         $( #note ).fadeout( slow );         return false; }); </code></pre>   <a href= http://jsfiddle.net/zvx8h/1/  rel= nofollow >http://jsfiddle.net/zvx8h/1/</a>,jquery

jquery single image gallery  hello everyone i m trying to make a script that increases an image based on a timeinterval. in fact i want it to browse through several images. so basically it enlarges image 1 for 5 seconds and than scales it back to normal size after five seconds it moves on to image 2 and enlarges that for 5 seconds as well. what i ve written so far is pretty basic and i m having trouble with moving through the images and the timeinterval s.   <pre><code>$( document ).ready(function(){ var image_id = 0; var get_image = document.getelementbyid(image_id); var image = $(get_image);  function increase_image() { image.animate({height: +=50   width: +=50 }   fast ); }  function reduce_image() { image.animate({height: -=50   width: -=50 }   fast ); image_id++; //alert(image_id); }  function active() {  } //this function is where i placed my time intervals first i want to image increase                                                 //time out to be properly viewed and then scaled back down function image_run() { window.setinterval(increase_image  5000); settimeout(active  10000); window.setinterval(reduce_image  11000); } $( span ).text(image_id);  image_run(); }); </code></pre>   i gave my html tags a numeric value like <code>id=0</code> my hope was that by incremental <code>image_id</code> it would pick up the next image in line  unfortunately it does not. the time intervals are behaving strangely too it runs the <code>increase_image()</code> function twice before running <code>reduce_image()</code> once (this is probably due to my use of the time interval since this is the first time i m utilizing them) i ve tried to fix my issue with a queue but ultimately that wasn t what i needed. i know for sure that the <code>image_id</code> gets upped by the code but it doesn t move on. i ve kept the <code>active()</code> function empty because i am not entirely sure what i want to do with this. i just needed a filler for the <code>timeout</code>. so could anyone push/point me in the right direction i d appreciate that a lot.    edit: okay so i fixed the problem is the  queue  part; i changed my code to    <pre><code>function image_run() { var number= 0; while(number &lt; 100000) { image.delay(10000).animate({height: +=50   width: +=50 }         fast ).delay(6000).animate({height: -=50   width: -=50 }   fast ).delay(6000); number++;; } } </code></pre>   now how do i make it rotate through all the images,jquery

assistance with jquery .children  im creating some buttons rollovers and for  graceful degradation  sake  and for the sake of not writing code for every image rollover etc  im <strong>trying</strong> to write better more efficient code. that said  what im wanting to do is that with a few lines of code  that my rollovers become a bit smarter about what they display on the screen.    one of the things im trying to achieve is that on rollover  that the text to appear in the center of the images div(via css absolute pos.) is the same text that is in the <strong>alt</strong> property/element of the image.    this is the reg div with thumbnail image:   <pre><code> &lt;div class= imgw &gt;&lt;img src= img src here /&gt;&lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>   now for the rollover  i add it via jquery :   <pre><code>$( .imgw ).prepend( &lt;div class= portsecrollover &gt;lopan&lt;/div&gt; ); </code></pre>   so on page render  it <strong>should</strong> be outputted like this:   <pre><code>&lt;div class= imgw &gt;   &lt;div class= portsecrollover &gt;lopan&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;img src= img src here /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>   at page load  portsecrollover is hidden via css.<code>(display:none);</code>    on rollover  portsecrollover is shown via jquery:   <pre><code>$( .imgw ).mouseover(function(){          $(this).children( .portsecrollover ).css( display   block );     }); </code></pre>   etc...    now on this same rollover function block above  what i wanted to do is that on rollover  the text to appear inside of portsecrollover div is the value of that divs image alt tag.    how can i achieve this     ive tried many approaches and they all end up as nothing. when i do a console.log on it to test it  i always get an  undefined  which leads me to assume im not targeting the correct dom object.    any ideas  ive tried many ways but  this is to give you an idea as to what ive tried...something like   <pre><code>$(this).children( .portsecrollover ).html($(this).children( a img ).attr( alt )); </code></pre>   thanks in advanced.,jquery

looping through unordered list with jquery prev next buttons  i have an unordered list with two links  a previous and next button. my goal is: when the previous button is clicked  the previous list item will change colors to red. when the next item is clicked  the next list item will change colors. when the last list item is reach and and next is clicked  it will loop back to the first one (and vice versa for previous link).    so far  i have this working at 95% using the jquery/html below:   <pre><code>&lt;div id= lessonthree &gt; &lt;a class= prev  href= # &gt;prev&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class= next  href= # &gt;next&lt;/a&gt;      &lt;ul&gt;         &lt;li&gt;ferrari&lt;/li&gt;         &lt;li&gt;lamborghini&lt;/li&gt;         &lt;li&gt;aston martin&lt;/li&gt;         &lt;li&gt;fiat&lt;/li&gt;         &lt;li&gt;saab&lt;/li&gt;         &lt;li&gt;harley davidson&lt;/li&gt;         &lt;li&gt;triumph&lt;/li&gt;         &lt;li&gt;zonda&lt;/li&gt;         &lt;li&gt;bugatti&lt;/li&gt;         &lt;li&gt;suzuki&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;/ul&gt;     &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>   start jquery   <pre><code>    var mycar = $( #lessonthree li ).length;     var linum = 0;          $( a.next ).click(function(){             $( #lessonthree li ).css( color   black );              if(mycar &gt; linum){                 $( #lessonthree li ).eq(linum).css( color    red );                 linum ++;             }              else {                 linum = 0;                 $( #lessonthree li ).eq(linum).css( color    red );             }             return false;         });          $( a.prev ).click(function(){             $( #lessonthree li ).css( color   black );              if(linum &gt; 0){                 linum --;                 $( #lessonthree li ).eq(linum).css( color    red );             }              else {                 linum = 9;                 $( #lessonthree li ).eq(linum).css( color    red );             }             return false;         }); </code></pre>   the problem is when you press  next  a few times and then press  previous   you need to press  previous  twice to get it to work. basically  when switching from previous to next  (or next to previous) you need to click the button twice in order to see jquery progress to the next or previous  list item. any ideas how i can fix my jquery to make this work on the first click,jquery

is it possible to selectively disable jquery ui selectable behavior on dynamically created elements   i want to accomplish this:   <pre><code>$( li.activerun ).live(selectable({disabled: true}); </code></pre>   or    <pre><code>$( li.activerun ).live( selectable   {disabled: true}  somefunction); </code></pre>   i know that syntax is wrong and will not run  but i want to be able to perform the equivalent and am wondering if this is possible. i am adding the .activerun class dynamically to certain list elements based on the results of an ajax submission  thus the live function. i want all list elements that have the class .activerun to be ineligible for selection via selectable().    is it possible  how to disable selectable() on future elements     or is it possible to use the filter option of selectable() to narrow down the range of elements that are able to be selected    <pre><code>$(  .selector  ).selectable({ filter: not .activerow }); </code></pre>   how would i use filter in this situation to make all elements that are not of class activerow selectable (in the future),jquery

form submit button state changes on selection  but not correct on page load  i have a simple jquery script that disables the submit button of a form when no valid option is selected.    this works if the page loads with the  select a procedure...  option selected. however  some pages load with prepopulated values  and as such.. the submit button loads as disabled.   <pre><code>$( #sidebar-before-after-select ).change(function() {     if (this.value ==  xx ) {         $( #sidebar-before-after-submit ).prop( disabled   true);     } else {         $( #sidebar-before-after-submit ).prop( disabled   false);     } }); </code></pre>   how can this be adjusted so it reads the current value on page load  as well as change,jquery
can i disable/remove disable from buttons if functions are met   i am setting up a function known as <code>insertquestion</code> where it appends table rows. i also have a <code>startvideoupload()</code> function where it starts the uploading and a <code>stopvideoupload()</code> function where it stops the file upload. now i mentioned in those functions that if the uploading is happening  disable the <code>upload</code> buttons  if the uploading has stopped then remove the disable from the <code>uplod</code> buttons. now what i want to do is that if the user appends a row while a file is uploading  then i want the  <code>upload</code> buttons that have been appended to be disabled  else if the upload has stopped when the row is appended  then remove the disable from the <code>upload</code> button.    my question is that is it possible to do this be checking in the <code>insertquestion()</code> function that if a file is uploading (if statement if <code>startvideoupload()</code> is true) then disable <code>upload</code> button else if no file is uploading (if statement if <code>stopvideoupload()</code> is true) then remove disable from <code>upload</code> buttons. if this can be done then how can the if statements be correctly coded to check if those functions are met     below is function where it would append rows (i have left it empty)   <pre><code>function insertquestion(form) {    } </code></pre>   below is relevant code where when it starts the file s uploading process   <pre><code>   function startvideoupload(videouploadform){            sourcevideoform = videouploadform;        $( .sbtnvideo ).attr( disabled    disabled );     });         return true;     } </code></pre>   below is relevant code for function when uploading has finished:   <pre><code>function stopvideoupload(success  videoid  videofilename){       $( .sbtnvideo ).removeattr( disabled );                return true;    } </code></pre>,jquery
changing the background color on update using jquery  i am trying to change the background color of elements when they are updated.      when the response comes back from the server  i want to change the background color of the elements for a second or so  then change it back to the original.  i can change the background color  but i can t change it back in the same call.      here is what i have so far:   <pre><code>$.each(thearray function(intindex objvalue){     $( #  + objvalue.id).parent().css( background-color   red ); }); //need timing event for delay  $.each(thearray function(intindex objvalue){     $( #  + objvalue.id).parent().css( background-color   transparent ); }); </code></pre>   the first loops works fine  but i can t get the other one to work.      i tried it this way:   <pre><code>$.each(thearray function(intindex objvalue){      $( #  + objvalue.id).parent.css( background-color   red ).delay(1000).css( background-color   transparent ); }); </code></pre>   and that didn t do anything either.    so i m not really sure what the problem is.  any suggestions,jquery

triggering a jquery function when the page loads and when a link is clicked   i m using this function:   <pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {  $( .gdthumbtext ) .contents() .filter( function(){     return this.nodetype == 3; }).each(function(){     this.nodevalue= this.nodevalue.replace(/\+/g   ); });  }); </code></pre>   to remove plus signs before numbers inside the <code>.gdthumbtext</code> div. now the problem is that the number will change with ajax each time you click a link with the class <code>.gdt-starrating.</code>    i guess i have to call (or recall) that function again when the link is clicked.    maybe i need something like this: call the function when page loads <strong>or</strong> when the link with class <code>.gdt-starrating</code> is clicked.    any suggestions of how to do that,jquery

reformatting a table based photo gallery to a ul based gallery  i have the following code:   <pre><code>var table = $( .photogallerytable ).before( &lt;ul class= photogallery &gt;&lt;/ul&gt; ) table.find( td a ).wrap( &lt;li&gt; ).parent().appendto( ul.photogallery ); table.remove(); </code></pre>   this code finds a table with a list of photos and re-codes it to use a unordered list instead. the script works perfectly except for one issue. if there are 2 galleries on a page  the script will grab all of the images and reformat them into one list. because the cms i m using tags each gallery table with .photogallerytable  i m not sure how to keep the script from touching the other galleries. what i would like to have happen is have the script re-format the first instance and then move on to the next instance  keeping the list of photos separate is that possible     here is a sample of the base table code;   <pre><code>&lt;table cellspacing= 0  class= photogallerytable &gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class= photogalleryitem &gt;&lt;a title=   href= /images/varsity_basketball/alexdefending.jpg  rel= lightbox[12828]  onclick= mylightbox.start(this);return false; &gt;&lt;img border= 0  alt=   src= /utilities/showthumbnail.aspx w=80&amp;amp;h=80&amp;amp;img=%5c%5c192.168.61.7%5canf01%5cyvir%5cfvgrf1%5c67982%5csbyqref%5c%5cvzntrf%5cinefvgl_onfxrgonyy%5cnyrkqrsraqvat.wct&amp;amp;usm=1 &gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class= photogalleryitem &gt;&lt;a title=   href= /images/varsity_basketball/cheerweb.jpg  rel= lightbox[12828]  onclick= mylightbox.start(this);return false; &gt;&lt;img border= 0  alt=   src= /utilities/showthumbnail.aspx w=80&amp;amp;h=80&amp;amp;img=%5c%5c192.168.61.7%5canf01%5cyvir%5cfvgrf1%5c67982%5csbyqref%5c%5cvzntrf%5cinefvgl_onfxrgonyy%5cpurrejro.wct&amp;amp;usm=1 &gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class= photogalleryitem &gt;&lt;a title=   href= /images/varsity_basketball/hoopcheerteamcombo.jpg  rel= lightbox[12828]  onclick= mylightbox.start(this);return false; &gt;&lt;img border= 0  alt=   src= /utilities/showthumbnail.aspx w=80&amp;amp;h=80&amp;amp;img=%5c%5c192.168.61.7%5canf01%5cyvir%5cfvgrf1%5c67982%5csbyqref%5c%5cvzntrf%5cinefvgl_onfxrgonyy%5cubbcpurregrnzpbzob.wct&amp;amp;usm=1 &gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class= photogalleryitem &gt;&lt;a title=   href= /images/varsity_basketball/piercepipes.jpg  rel= lightbox[12828]  onclick= mylightbox.start(this);return false; &gt;&lt;img border= 0  alt=   src= /utilities/showthumbnail.aspx w=80&amp;amp;h=80&amp;amp;img=%5c%5c192.168.61.7%5canf01%5cyvir%5cfvgrf1%5c67982%5csbyqref%5c%5cvzntrf%5cinefvgl_onfxrgonyy%5ccvreprcvcrf.wct&amp;amp;usm=1 &gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class= photogalleryitem &gt;&lt;a title=   href= /images/varsity_basketball/scrappyonfloor.jpg  rel= lightbox[12828]  onclick= mylightbox.start(this);return false; &gt;&lt;img border= 0  alt=   src= /utilities/showthumbnail.aspx w=80&amp;amp;h=80&amp;amp;img=%5c%5c192.168.61.7%5canf01%5cyvir%5cfvgrf1%5c67982%5csbyqref%5c%5cvzntrf%5cinefvgl_onfxrgonyy%5cfpencclbasybbe.wct&amp;amp;usm=1 &gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class= photogalleryitem &gt;&lt;a title=   href= /images/varsity_basketball/teamabove.jpg  rel= lightbox[12828]  onclick= mylightbox.start(this);return false; &gt;&lt;img border= 0  alt=   src= /utilities/showthumbnail.aspx w=80&amp;amp;h=80&amp;amp;img=%5c%5c192.168.61.7%5canf01%5cyvir%5cfvgrf1%5c67982%5csbyqref%5c%5cvzntrf%5cinefvgl_onfxrgonyy%5cgrnznobir.wct&amp;amp;usm=1 &gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class= photogalleryitem &gt;&lt;a title=   href= /images/varsity_basketball/teamarms.jpg  rel= lightbox[12828]  onclick= mylightbox.start(this);return false; &gt;&lt;img border= 0  alt=   src= /utilities/showthumbnail.aspx w=80&amp;amp;h=80&amp;amp;img=%5c%5c192.168.61.7%5canf01%5cyvir%5cfvgrf1%5c67982%5csbyqref%5c%5cvzntrf%5cinefvgl_onfxrgonyy%5cgrnznezf.wct&amp;amp;usm=1 &gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class= photogalleryitem &gt;&lt;a title=   href= /images/varsity_basketball/yeisson.jpg  rel= lightbox[12828]  onclick= mylightbox.start(this);return false; &gt;&lt;img border= 0  alt=   src= /utilities/showthumbnail.aspx w=80&amp;amp;h=80&amp;amp;img=%5c%5c192.168.61.7%5canf01%5cyvir%5cfvgrf1%5c67982%5csbyqref%5c%5cvzntrf%5cinefvgl_onfxrgonyy%5clrvffba.wct&amp;amp;usm=1 &gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan= 4  class= photogallerynavigation &gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt; </code></pre>,jquery

which jquery is best to use  i want to change a selected button (buttons = .answerbtns) to an unselected button if optiondropid (drop down menu) option changes.    below is jquery code for drop down menus   <pre><code>$(document).ready(function () {     var optdrop = new array();      optdrop.abc = [   1 2];     optdrop.abcd = [   1 2 3];     optdrop.abcde = [   1 2 3 4];     optdrop.trueorfalse = [1];     optdrop.yesorno = [1];      $( #optiondropid ).change(function ()     {         var selectedvalue = $(this).val();         $( #numberdropid ).html(  );         $.each(optdrop[selectedvalue]  function (x  y)         {             $( #numberdropid ).append($( &lt;option&gt;&lt;/option&gt; ).attr( value   y).html(y));         });      });      $( #optiondropid ).change(); });  </code></pre>   now what i want to know is which jquery feature is best to use to unselect a selected button if the dropdown option in optiondropid changes.    is it the remove attribute code below:   <pre><code>$( .answerbtns ).bind( click   function(){     $( .answerbtns ).removeattr( selected );;     return false; }); </code></pre>   or is it returning false for the answer buttons below:   <pre><code> $( .answerbtns ).bind( click   function(){     $( .answerbtns ).attr( selected   false);     return false; </code></pre>   which one is the best to use in my code     to look at full code then click <a href= http://jsfiddle.net/qm9hp/1/  rel= nofollow >here</a>,jquery
jquery select by id or by class   i have five different input controls on a page  each with a different id and name  and a class as well.   <pre><code>&lt;input id= txtname1  name= txtname1  class= jname  type= text  /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;input id= txtname2  name= txtname2  class= jname  type= text  /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;input id= txtname3  name= txtname3  class= jname  type= text  /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;input id= txtname4  name= txtname4  class= jname  type= text  /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;input id= txtname5  name= txtname5  class= jname  type= text  /&gt; </code></pre>   which is the more efficient manner when using jquery to select a group of inputs by to register the blur event  the reason i ask is because i actually have 20 of these input controls on the page and i want the jquery select to be as quick as possible.    <strong>1) select by tag id:</strong>   <pre><code>$(document).on( blur    input[id*= _txtname ]   function ($e) {   alert( blur event successful ); }) </code></pre>   or    <strong>2) select by class:</strong>   <pre><code>$(document).on( blur    .jname   function ($e) {   alert( blur event successful ); }) </code></pre>   <strong>edit:</strong>  my intent here is to hook the blur event up to all of the input elements in the code above. sorry for the confusion here  folks.,jquery

insert html content at certain index with jquery  i m having a strange situation here.. i have three links which are loading content with ajax. first time when one of these three links is pressed  the content is sliding down but i want that the next li to animate left/right depending on their position in main menu. right now they are appended to the #content element.    what i want is to give the loaded content from the start a certain index.. as the index which appear in the main menu..    you can see an example at <a href= http://www.openminded.ro/  rel= nofollow >http://www.openminded.ro/</a>    this is the script i m using right now:   <pre><code>// javascript document $(document).ready(function(){     $( #main-menu a ).click(function(e){         e.preventdefault();          var $a = $(this);         var $clicked = $a.attr( href ).substr(1);          if($( #logo ).hasclass( unmoved )) {             $( #logo ).animate({margintop: 30px }  500  function(){                 $a.removeclass( unmoved ).addclass( moved );             });          }          $( #main-menu .active ).removeclass( active );         $a.addclass( active );          if($( #content ul li.  + $clicked).length == 0) {             $.ajax({                 url:  /resources/ui  + $(this).attr( href ) +  .php                   cache: false             }).done(function(html) {                 if($( #content ul ).html().trim().length == 0) {                     $( #content ul ).html(html).find( li ).slidedown(500);                 } else {                     $( #content ul ).css( width  ($( #content ul ).width() + 900) +  px );                     $( #content ul ).append(html).find( li.  + $clicked);                     $a.trigger( click );                 }             });         } else {             $( #content ul ).animate({left:-$( #content ul li.  + $clicked).index() * 900 +  px }  500   easeinquart );         }      }); }); </code></pre>   right now everything works ok if you press the links in order: about us / portofolio / contact but if you start with portofolio link and then you press about us.. you ll see that about us is after portofolio but it must be before it.. i want to set it s index from the start..    when i load it i want to set about us at index 0  portofolio 1 and contact 2 without being dependent if one of these three links has been pressed before    is there a solution  or i have to do it in hard way,jquery

how do i add an onclick function to all matched elements  this function only works once  when i click an anchor element again  nothign happens.  i thought the selector would apply the .click function to all matched elements       <pre><code> $( #welcome-nav li a ).click(function (e) {    // prevent anchor from firing     e.preventdefault();      var chosenelement = $(this).parent().attr( class );     var index = articles.indexof( .  + chosenelement) + 1;      //remove all classes of active on articles     $.each(articles  function (index  value) {         $(value).removeclass( active );    })      $( .  + chosenelement).addclass( active );     $( #sharpcontainer ).bgstretcher.sliderdestroy();     startbgstretcher(returnimagearray(index));    }) </code></pre>   below is the plugin that i think is breaking the onclick function   <pre><code>    $( #sharpcontainer ).bgstretcher({          images: imagecontainer          anchoring:  left top   //anchoring bgstrtcher area regarding window         anchoringimg:  left top     //anchoring images regarding window         nextslidedelay: 8000  //numeric value in milliseconds. the parameter sets delay until next slide should start.         slideshowspeed: 2000  //numeric value in milliseconds or(’fast’  ‘normal’  ’slow’). the parameter sets the speed of transition between images         transitioneffect:  superslide           slidedirection:  w           callbackfunction: homepageslide     });    function homepageslide() {      //homepage slide is called after a slide has loaded     var index = $( li.bgs-current ).index();      //hide current article     $.each(articles  function (index  value) {          $(value).removeclass( active );     })      //show next article     $(articles[index]).addclass( active );   } </code></pre>,jquery

change dangerous swiper settings on resize - reload slider  i have the following  responsive  slider made with dangerous swiper  on mobile under 653px it shows 1 slide at a time  and on desktop above 653px it shows as many that can fit in: if you load  the page at each screen size it seems to work fine  however when you resize (the browser) it sometimes gets a bit messed up. i.e. slides drop down  or the slides width changes when you resize back up again    at the moment i have the following code for the resize part:   <pre><code>$(window).resize(function() {            var browserwidthresize = $(window).width(); // new width                  if (browserwidthresize &lt; 653) {                         myswiper.params.slidesperview=1                   } else {                        myswiper.params.slidesperview= auto                   }         });      </code></pre>   this changes the slidesperview parameter on resize.    however i m guessing that it might be best to reload the slider altogether with the new settings on resize  or could be there be a better way to tackle this      you can see it in action here:    <a href= http://machinas.com/wip/hugoboss/responsive-template/v1/  rel= nofollow >http://machinas.com/wip/hugoboss/responsive-template/v1/</a>    thanks.,jquery

why isn t my dynamic price working till the quantity is over 2   i m building a dynamic price into a magento product page and i m having an issue with some quantity up / down buttons when the quantity increases or decrease the price will change to reflect the new price.    ive got the calculations working to change the base price when the quantity goes over 3  5 or 10 so thats not an issue its the fact its reflecting the price when it has a quantity of 2 but its on 1.    any ideas would be awesome.    <a href= https://i.stack.imgur.com/tra42.gif  rel= nofollow noreferrer ><img src= https://i.stack.imgur.com/tra42.gif  alt= enter image description here ></a>   <pre><code>//quantity buttons  var upbtn = jquery( #btn-qty-up ); var downbtn = jquery( #btn-qty-down ); var currentqty = document.getelementbyid( qty_extention );  var qty = currentqty.value;  if(qty &lt; 2){  } downbtn.click(function(){     var currentqty = document.getelementbyid( qty_extention );      var qty = currentqty.value;      //console.log(qty);     //console.log( down );     if(!isnan( qty ) &amp;&amp; qty &gt; 0 ){         currentqty.value--;           //varibles declared          var newprice = jquery( #dynamic_pricing ).find( h1 );         var screwinput = jquery( select#attribute186 ).find( :selected ).text();          var calprice;         var qtyprice;          //if quantity is empty or null give warning and stop         /*if(qty.length === 0 || qty ===   ){             //warnings.show().html( quantity missing ).delay(3000).fadeout(500);             stop();         } */          //if quantity is more than x then price is x         switch(true) {             case (qty &lt;= 2):                 qtyprice =  12.95 ;                 break;             case (qty &gt;=3 &amp;&amp; qty &lt;= 4):                 qtyprice =  12.30 ;                 break;             case (qty &gt;=5 &amp;&amp; qty &lt;= 9):                 qtyprice =  11.65 ;                 break;             case (qty &gt;=10):                 qtyprice =  10.95 ;                 break;         }          //if(screwinput ==  no ) {             calprice = (qtyprice * qty);         //} else {         //   calprice = ((1.95 * quantity) + (qtyprice * quantity));         //}          newprice.html( £  + calprice.tofixed(2));      }                  return false; });  upbtn.click(function(){     var currentqty = document.getelementbyid( qty_extention );      var qty = currentqty.value;      //console.log(qty);     //console.log( up );     if( !isnan( qty )) {         currentqty.value++;          //varibles declared          var newprice = jquery( #dynamic_pricing ).find( h1 );         var screwinput = jquery( select#attribute186 ).find( :selected ).text();          var calprice;         var qtyprice;          //if quantity is empty or null give warning and stop         /*         if(qty.length === 0 || qty ===   ){             //warnings.show().html( quantity missing ).delay(3000).fadeout(500);             stop();         } */          //if quantity is more than x then price is x         switch(true) {             case (qty &lt;= 2):                 qtyprice =  12.95 ;                 break;             case (qty &gt;=3 &amp;&amp; qty &lt;= 4):                 qtyprice =  12.30 ;                 break;             case (qty &gt;=5 &amp;&amp; qty &lt;= 9):                 qtyprice =  11.65 ;                 break;             case (qty &gt;=10):                 qtyprice =  10.95 ;                 break;         }          //if(screwinput ==  no ) {             calprice = (qtyprice * qty);         //} else {         //   calprice = ((1.95 * quantity) + (qtyprice * quantity));         //}          newprice.html( £  + calprice.tofixed(2));     }         return false; }) </code></pre>,jquery

iterating through each h2 and append their values to another set of divs in order  i have a question.     how would i iterate through each h2 in their div  grab their text value and appending that to the other set of divs in the order that they appear on the other side     i could use eq or something and go through each one but this isn t ideal as the number of divs at any given time could be more or less and i ll only have to go back and adjust the js to adjust for the number of divs.    there is no js i ve done yet in this example just because i m not sure how to approach this.    any help is appreciated.     <a href= http://jsfiddle.net/u2vy5/  rel= nofollow >fiddle example</a>    thanks,jquery

problems accessing newly built elements  this one is killing me :(. i m loading saved filter sets and building each filter dynamically  inside a $.get() response function. i m finding that  even though i m correctly creating unique ids for each of my selects and inputs  i m not able to access the values of these inputs while inside the function that builds them. i tried multiple ways of adding delays to the jquery selection process but nothing worked.   <pre><code>function onsavedfilterchange(item){     $.get( url           function(response) {             //filters with uniquely id d inputs get built here             //can t access them here  immediately after creation         }     );     // can t access them here either } $(document).ready(function(){     $( #randombutton ).click(function(){         // but here  i can access the new inputs!!     }); }); </code></pre>   my way of adding the elements is a bit complicated and may be the root of my problems. for each saved filter set returned  i start by cloning an initialized div and setting it s id attribute:   <pre><code>newfilter = $( #initialfilter ) .clone() .removeattr( id ) .attr( id    fd_ +filtercount); </code></pre>   this div has three inputs; the first two are selects  the third can be a select or a text input. after that div has been cloned  i set the value of the first select like so:   <pre><code>var thisselect = newfilter.find( select.filterby ); var thisfieldname = rows[filtercount-1][ field_name ]; thisselect.val(thisfieldname); </code></pre>   next  depending upon the value of thisfieldname  i build the options of the second select using another ajax call  and i build the third input using yet another ajax call.    and it just occurred to me... because i m modifying an existing site built with coldfusion  the last two ajax calls are called through extjs ajax proxies. i m gonna bet that extjs isn t playing nice with jquery and i m going to have to rewrite those two functions.    either that or i m insane to nest get calls inside get calls,jquery

jquery autocomplete-style search box to pull list of links from page  i have a newsroom page  with a short list of articles. i m not using a database or a cms for this  so for the time being  i d like to implement a quick search functionality to parse through the list of titles using a search box.    i d like to be able to start typing into the input box  and perhaps use .find() to parse through the list of articles  then have a list or result below the search box in a div (similar to autocomplete) and have the links to the article be clickable to the articles themselves. i m already using jquery  so i d rather not have to use jqueryui as well  so any tips on how to go about accomplishing this,jquery

associating additional info in dropdown  i have the following function in jquery 1.10   <pre><code>$( #num ).blur(function(){    $(this).format({syntax: # ###.00   locale: us }); }); </code></pre>   i want to read syntax and locale dynamically from a dropdwon instead of hardcoding it. however in the dropdown  i want to show only country names like this:   <ul> <li>united states </li> <li>arab emirates </li> <li>egypt</li> <li>and so on</li> </ul>   us is the default selection. on selecting the country  the syntax and locale associated (which is stored somewhere i am not sure how) should be read automatically    united states -> syntax:  # ###.00  locale:  us <br> arab emirates -> syntax:  ## ##.000  locale:  ae  and so on..    how can i make the blur function read these values. how to store these values and associate them with dropdown selected text.,jquery

conflict between blur on textarea and submit on input button  i have a text area and a button. i have code that extends the text area on focus and shrinks on blur event. when the user presses the button  it submits the content to server. the issue is that when user types text and then clicks the button  it results in blur event on text area before the click on button. the box shrinks but the button click action gets masked. i have gone through various threads on similar topic and have already tried various options but neither worked...   <ol> <li> tried to add this in blur handler... but didn t help...   <pre><code>if ($( :focus ).is( #submitbtn )) { return false; } </code></pre></li> <li> tried adding this to blur handler... but it didn t work in ie even though it worked in chrome...    <pre><code>if (event.relatedtarget != null &amp;&amp; event.relatedtarget.nodename ==  input ) {    // now call click on the related target which was the submit button    event.relatedtarget.click();  } </code></pre></li> <li> tried following approach but didn t help...   <pre><code>$( #mytextarea ).blur(function(evt) {      if (evt.target is not the button){ //pseudo code        //do something         return true; // i handled it      }      return false; // i didn t handle it  }) </code></pre></li> </ol>   any other solutions,jquery

jquery: how can i select only the checkboxes that are visible and checked   i m trying to check whether or not all the visible check boxes in a certain series are checked  and i thought of just counting those that are visible and those that are visible and checked to see if the numbers are the same. the problem is i can t get the visible nor the checked selectors to work.    these are some of the ideas i had but didn t work:    <pre><code>if($j( input[id^= chk_camp ]:visible:checked ).length == $j( input[id^= chk_camp ]:visible ).length) </code></pre>   both sides are 0 in this case   <pre><code>if($j( input[id^= chk_camp ] ).filter( :visible ).filter( :checked ).length == $j( input[id^= chk_camp ] ).filter( :visible ).length) </code></pre>   also returned 0 on both sides.    also tried    <pre><code>if($j( input[id^= chk_camp ][visible][checked] ).length == $j( input[id^= chk_camp ][visible] ).length) </code></pre>   and this also returns 0 on both sides.    as a note <code>$j( input[id^= chk_camp ] ).length</code> returns the correct value. also the browser i m working with is firefox.    what am i doing wrong here     answer: aparently what i m doing wrong is somewhere else. i was doing these checks before actually making the div containing the checkboxes visible so all the visibility checks were returning false.,jquery

can i reduce my jquery code of many .on statements   i am currently building a web application and i am basically building it using a lot of ajax requests  which require for me to use the <code>.on()</code> selector from jquery to dynamically use elements. i have noticed though that my script is getting awfully long and it is very much the same code  but different functions to execute.    for example the code goes on like this:   <pre> $(function() {      $(document).on( click    .el01   function() {         executefunctiona($(this).data( x ));     });      $(document).on( click    .el02   function() {         showdivfunction();         executefunctionb(true);     });      $(document).on( click    .el03   function() {         executefunctionc($(this).data( x )  300  false  function() {             returnsomethingfromfunctiond();         });     });      ............. goes on for another 600 lines  }); </pre>   i was wondering if there was a way to reduce all these <code>$(document).on()</code> statements  it would be stupid for me to continue like this if there was an easier way that reduces the amount of code. maybe something like making <code>$(document).on( click )</code> a selector that i can call using <code>__c( el   f() {})</code> or something like that,jquery

toggle checked on checkbox when spacebar is pressed  i have a small snippet of code which i use to toggle the <code>checked</code> property of a checkbox when the <kbd>space bar</kbd> is pressed.   <pre><code>$(document).on( keydown   function(e) {   if (e.which === 32) {     e.preventdefault();     $( #example ).prop( checked   function() {       return !this.checked;     });   } }); </code></pre>   the above works fine in chrome v30 and ie10  but not in firefox v24. the problem occurs when you <strong>click</strong> the checkbox  and then use the space bar to toggle it  it momentarily checks it  and then unchecks it  and vice versa.    i believe the problem has something to do with the fact that the <code>click</code> event is triggered in firefox when using <code>keydown()</code>  despite using <code>e.preventdefault()</code> (which prevents the click event from triggering in both chrome and ie).    i tried using the same code  binding the <code>keyup</code> event. this fixed the problem in firefox  but then introduced the same problem to ie.   <h3><a href= http://jsfiddle.net/3pmvw/8/  rel= nofollow >here s the fiddle where firefox is affected</a></h3>   does anybody know why this is happening  and how i can get around it,jquery

$ is not defined after page reload  i am using jquery in a page. i am calling the script from the head section through googleapis cdn. at the end of my page i use   <pre><code>$(document).ready(function () {     // code    //    // do something    //       //    setinterval(function() { location.reload(true); }  40000);   }); </code></pre>   the problem is that many times after the page refreshes i am getting the error:   <pre><code>$ is not defined  </code></pre>   on document.ready line    and the script stops.    for some reason the jquery in the head is not loaded and throws the error. this happens only when the page loads through javascript location.reload(true) method.    why      the page is placed in an iframe. but the error is also happening if it is called directly.,jquery

jquery modals and deep linking  i currently have a gallery which opens a modal pop up when you click on the thumbnail. what i would like to do is to be able to generate a unique link specifically for the modal (i.e.; www.mywebite.com/#link1)  which loads it s content via ajax. if somebody was to send this unique modal link and send it to someone and they were to paste it into their browser  ideally i would like the modal window to load and display its content automatically  without the user having to click on the appropriate thumbnail.    is this even possible   i know this is not the easiest of tasks and any help with this would be greatly appreciated.    to get an idea of what i m working on go to: <a href= http://www.ddbremedy.co.uk/siteupdate/work  rel= nofollow >http://www.ddbremedy.co.uk/siteupdate/work</a>    you will see an imac screen with the thumbnails on it.    many thanks in advance.    update!!!!!    ok this is where i am currently at. i have decided to scrap using jquery address and am deep linking using  window.location.hash  instead.    code is something like this:   <pre><code>var base_url =  http://www.ddbremedy.co.uk/siteupdate/ ;  $( #work_gallery li a ).on( click   function(event) {      event.preventdefault();     postlink = $(this).attr( href );     window.location.hash = postlink.replace(base_url    );       /* i have a bunch of code that animates the modal window      in which i don t need to include as there is quite alot of it.     content loads via ajax. then when i close the modal i add this      code to remove the hash and revert the link back to its original state. */      if ( pushstate  in history) {         history.pushstate(    document.title  window.location.pathname);     } else {         window.location.hash =   ;     }  }); </code></pre>   the above code works fine and displays the link exactly as i want it to when i load and close external content with ajax. now what i need to figure out is how i can automatically load the ajax content if somebody takes that link and pastes it in the address bar.  the content is loaded based on the links href and a click event  so how would i trick the browser into thinking that the correct link was clicked and load the correct content  purely based on it s link,jquery

jquery .on() troubles  ok guys  i ve used .on before quite successfully  however  this time it isn t working as expected  because it s not recognizing dynamic elements at all!      see issue by visiting <a href= http://www.metalgains.com  rel= nofollow >http://www.metalgains.com</a> . click  view demo  and just login with the demo credentials. if you click on a  pencil  you ll see the edit functionality work.  however  if you add an asset  and then click on the pencil that was added  you ll see it doesn t work.    at some point this line of code is dynamically added:    <pre><code> &lt;div class= edit-item &gt;&lt;a name=  +$id+   href= #add-asset- +status+   class= edit &gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>   the javascript i want to invoke is below. mind you  it does work on page load  just not on anything dynamic. what am i missing    <pre><code>$( .edit-item .edit ).on( click   function(){     return false;   }).each(function(){             $(this).fancybox({              afterclose: function(){             //we have to remove this class so that if someone tries to add a new asset it will use the              //add script and not the update script             $( .asset-form ).removeclass( update );             //we need to set the values back to empty so that they aren t prepopulated when someone              //tries to add an asset later.             $( .asset-form :input[name= type ] ).val(  );             $( .asset-form :input[name= year ] ).val(  );             $( .asset-form :input[name= quantity ] ).val(  );             $( .asset-form :input[name= ounces ] ).val(  );             $( .asset-form :input[name= paid ] ).val(  );             $( .asset-form :input[name= date ] ).val(  );             $( .asset-form :input[name= notes ] ).val(  );              //we remove the hidden field that passes the asset id.              $( .asset-form :input[name= editid ] ).remove();                }//end afterclose     }); //end edit fancybox }); //end each </code></pre>   by the way  this works perfectly:   <pre><code>   $( .note-img ).on( click   function(){ return false; }).each(function(){     $(this).fancybox();     }); </code></pre>   in relation to this dynamically added content:   <pre><code>   &lt;a href= #note- +$id+   class= note-img &gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class= note  id= note- +$id+  &gt; +$notes+ &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>,jquery

click and .next() - a better way   example - <a href= http://jsfiddle.net/s4nyu/2/  rel= nofollow >jsfiddle</a>    so i built a simple slider using the following code:   <pre><code>activeslide.removeclass( active )     .next().addclass( active )  if (activeslide.next().length === 0) {     firstslide.addclass( active ); } </code></pre>   it all works lovely. i thought i could perhaps use something similar to create a forward and back button:   <pre><code>control.on( click    a.next   function() {     activeslide = activeslide         .next().removeclass( active )         .next().addclass( active ); }); </code></pre>   it works okay for the middle slides (a little slow )  but doesn t seem to trigger on the first or last.     if anyone has a suggestion for a better way  or has an idea on how to tweak the above code  it would be greatly appreciated.,jquery

when i change an option it is selected in another place  i have a slight problem with my application.    it is very difficult to explain but if you follow the steps below in my fiddle then you will understand it a lot better.    1: open the grid and select option  5 . the textbox would show the value  5 .    2: click on the  add question  button  a new row would appear showing option value selected in a text box.    3: now click on the  open grid  link within the row and select option  8 . the textbox within the row changes to show value  8 .    but go back to the option feature on the top and click on  open grid   the textbox still states  5  which is correct but it states option  8  is selected when it still should be option  5 .    so how can i get it so that if the user changes an option from within a table row  it does not change the option selected at the top     my code is in the fiddle  please use it to test your ideas. <a href= http://jsfiddle.net/f8ckm/23/  rel= nofollow >click here</a>,jquery

fire additional jquery after ajax load  i m working on a system that was not originally developed by me and i am not nearly as familiar with jquery as the original developers.     they have an ajax call bound to a click as follows in a .js file:   <pre><code>$( .edit-btn ).bind( click   function(e) { *** ajax stuff here *** }); </code></pre>   i m trying to get the page so that this ajax fires without any user input in a specific scenario. i have done this part successfully - if php detects certain conditions then this is inserted as script in the html file:   <pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {     $( #project-costs ).find( .edit-btn ).click(); }); </code></pre>   what i need to do next is fire an additional jquery command once the ajax content has loaded:   <pre><code>    $( #tasklist ).find( .steps-toggle ).last().click(); </code></pre>   i ve tried a few approaches to this but i haven t got it to work properly  including:   <ul> <li>nesting the command in ( #tasklist ).ready </li> <li>putting it inside an ajaxcomplete thing </li> <li>adding the line to the bottom of the ajax function - this actually works but then it fires the additional command every time  when i only want it in those certain circumstances.</li> </ul>   any help appreciated.,jquery

selecting a link inside a class with jquery when there are multiple uses of that class  i ve been stuck on this code for 2 days now and i m pretty sure it s relatively simple. basically i created the periodic table of elements to practice some html/css and then i decided to make it interactive with jquery. all i want is to click on a element and a new window opens taking you to that wikipedia site for that element. i ve only input links into the far left row to get the code right first. the problem is that all of the elements have the same class  box  so when i select that with jquery and get the link inside that  it returns all the links in the page because every element has that same  box  class. any nudge in the right direction would be fantastic.     thanks!    here s the link.     html:    <pre><code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;

jquery & ie - event firing delay  i m working with a bar code reader that dumps in data in keyboard mode into a text box. it basically types in a bunch of numbers (about 250 characters) quickly. there is a start character  %  that i m looking for and when that comes across i want to display a working/waiting image while the rest of the data comes in.     this works perfectly in firefox and chrome and of course not ie. in ie  the image only gets displayed after all of the data has been read into the text box so it s basically delaying firing that event for some reason. any idea how to get this working     here s the code:   <pre><code>$( * ).bind( keypress   function () {     if (event.keycode ==  037 ) {         $( #&lt;%= this.txtdata.clientid %&gt; ).focus();         $( #processingdata ).fadein( slow   function () { });     } }); </code></pre>   ps. i m listening for all keypresses and on the  %  key press it sets the focus on the textbox to read the data.,jquery
dynamic elements in jquery $.each  i have the following code:   <pre><code>  var supportoninput =  oninput  in document.createelement( input );    $( input[maxlength]  textarea[maxlength] ).each(function() {     var $this = $(this);     var maxlength = parseint($this.attr( maxlength ));     $this.attr( maxlength   null);      var el = $( &lt;span class=\ character-count label bg-success\ &gt;  + maxlength +  &lt;/span&gt; );     el.insertafter($this);      $this.bind(supportoninput    input  :  keyup   function() {       var cc = $this.val().length;       el.text(maxlength - cc);       if(maxlength &lt; cc) {         el.addclass( bg-danger );       } else {         el.removeclass( bg-danger );       }     });   }); </code></pre>   the problem is there are dynamically-generated input elements it needs to account for. changing <code>bind</code> to <code>on</code> won t necessarily solve it since the problem lies in the <code>each</code> iterator. is there a smart solution for getting that to work     <strong>update:</strong>    to elaborate on the problem  i have a comment form that accepts input up to a certain length. the script above performs client-side validation for the length of the field. it works fine normally  but if the field itself was generated dynamically (say  a post added via ajax that has a comment field that needs this validation)  it doesn t work. i presume it s occurring in the <code>$.each()</code> iterator function  because that only looks through the currently-existing elements when the page is loaded  and it s not bound the way <code>.on()</code> is. so  my question is  what s the smartest way to replace the above code so it does work with dynamically generated elements,jquery
can we make a call to server through jquery ajax  i am trying to hit the server from the local host but it is not to hitting it. it not going to hit the url.  how can i resolve it   up to else block i put alert it is going then it is not hitting the server through url.  if both the username and password are entered it has to go the server and execute the sql query and get back the result to the same page. i am doing it from an html page   <pre><code>&lt;script type= text/javascript &gt;     $.ajax({         type: post           url: http://google.com  //here i am getting the problem         data:datastring          success:function(data) {             alert( success );         } error :function(data) {         alert( error has occured );         }     });     }     return false; &lt;/script&gt; </code></pre>   i am doing it for login page.    thanks.,jquery

two independent drop down boxes. one onclick the other on hover  this may seem like a simple and straightforward question and it probably has a straightforward answer. i have two drop down boxes in my toolbar  one that drops on hover and the other on click and the other on hover.     i can t for the life of me figure out how to make them run independently. i am very new to jquery and have scoured the internet before coming here.    fiddle without css but still does same thing.    <a href= http://jsfiddle.net/gqtuh/  rel= nofollow >http://jsfiddle.net/gqtuh/</a>    here is the jquery   <pre><code>$(document).ready(function () {   $( #discoverdrop ).hover(     function () {         //show its submenu         $( ul  this ).slidedown(500);      }       function () {         //hide its submenu         $( ul  thid ).slideup(500);           });    $( #profile ).toggle(function(){         $( ul  this ).slidedown(500);     }  function(){         $( ul  this ).slideup(500);     });   }); </code></pre>   and the neccesary markup   <pre><code>&lt;span id= discoverdrop &gt;        &lt;span id= drop &gt;&lt;m2&gt;discover&lt;/m2&gt;         &lt;ul&gt;          &lt;li&gt;&lt;m2&gt;&lt;a href= ../artists &gt;&lt;m2&gt;artists&lt;/m2&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/m2&gt;          &lt;li&gt;&lt;m2&gt;&lt;a href= ../tracks &gt;&lt;m2&gt;tracks&lt;/m2&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/m2&gt;          &lt;li&gt;&lt;m2&gt;&lt;a href= ../sessions &gt;&lt;m2&gt;sessions&lt;/m2&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/m2&gt;          &lt;li&gt;&lt;m2&gt;&lt;a href= ../gigs &gt;&lt;m2&gt;gigs&lt;/m2&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/m2&gt;         &lt;/ul&gt;                 &lt;/span&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span id= profile &gt;         &lt;span id= profiledrop &gt;           &lt;ul&gt;            &lt;li&gt;&lt;m2&gt;&lt;a href= ../phpscripts/logout.php &gt;&lt;m2&gt;logout&lt;/m2&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/m2&gt;            &lt;li&gt;&lt;m2&gt;&lt;a href= ../tracks &gt;&lt;m2&gt;tracks&lt;/m2&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/m2&gt;            &lt;li&gt;&lt;m2&gt;&lt;a href= ../sessions &gt;&lt;m2&gt;sessions&lt;/m2&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/m2&gt;            &lt;li&gt;&lt;m2&gt;&lt;a href= ../gigs &gt;&lt;m2&gt;gigs&lt;/m2&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/m2&gt;         &lt;/ul&gt;                  &lt;/span&gt;       &lt;/span&gt; </code></pre>,jquery

detecting change completion on form input  i have a fetish for building online calculators without the big  calculate  button. i.e.  the calculations occur on change event without users clicking on the calculate button. unfortunately  many users just enter data and scroll down to see the results without tabbing out or clicking elsewhere on the screen. this behaviour doesn t trigger the change event and so the results don t update.    here are some scenarios where i consider user input is complete:   <ol> <li>user enters data and tabs out (change) </li> <li>user enters data and moves the mouse out from the text box (keypress/input followed by mouseleave)</li> <li>user tabs into the input field  enters data and moves the mouse a certain distance elsewhere. i.e.  mouse isn t on the input field at any time.</li> </ol>   implementing #1 &amp; #2 should be easy. i am trying to see how best to implement #3 using jquery. are there any jquery plugins available to help me with all the above or just #3      or  should i just abandon all this and put a big calculate button,jquery

check if variable is good for jquery each  i personally love $.each function - it allows working with arrays and objects in simple and equal way. but somtimes when some part of application passes non-object to that function i get runtime error  can t get property length of undefined .    such error is really diffucult to debug because it s not known which on of $.each functions caused it. so what i think - it s easier for me to make object check before every $.each call.    how do i check if object suits $.each function  may be there is a way to extend jquery function - to at least know what was sent to $.each  becuse overwise searching for runtime error is quite difficult - i have 370+ usages of $.each in code ...    thanks in advance!    edit:   <pre><code>var obj = {1: [{}  {}]  2: []}; $.each(obj  function(key  value){      $.each(value  function(index  el){     //fails with  uncaught typeerror: cannot read property  length  of undefined      })  }) </code></pre>,jquery

jquery animate function step parameter not evaluated at each step  i want to check one condition specified in the step function of jquery animate function. but  for some reason the step function is executed only few times and does not seem to be executed every single step of animation. i want to check a condition on every step of movement so that i can then change the animation if condition is met.     here is the code:   <pre><code>// orig position of #testball is 0px left and 0px top $( #testball ).animate({             left: 500px               top : 500px              }  {            speed:  slow              step: function(now  fx) {             alert( hello );                   if((testball.offsetleft &gt;= barline5.offsetleft) &amp;&amp; (testball.offsetleft &lt;= barline5.offsetleft))                  {                                             testball.style.backgroundcolor =  yellow ;                  }         }       }); </code></pre>   i want the step function to be executed on every small movement of the object. but in this case  the step function is called only 4-5 times when animated from 0px to 500px(i thought it would be executed on every pixel animation). and so the condition is not properly evaluated.     please share if you know why the step function is not been executed on every small movement.,jquery

jquery for each child checkbox in a paragraph id  how do i select each child checkbox inside a paragraph named id= paragraph1  and uncheck it if its checked and then disable it in jquery.    example:   <pre><code>&lt;input type= checkbox  id= chkmain &gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p id= paragraph1 &gt;     &lt;input type= checkbox  id chk1 &gt;&lt;br /&gt;     &lt;input type= checkbox  id chk2 &gt;&lt;br /&gt;     &lt;input type= checkbox  id chk3 &gt;&lt;br /&gt;     &lt;input type= checkbox  id chk4 &gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt; </code></pre>   jquery selection:   <pre><code>$( #chkmain:not(:checked) ).change(function() {     $( #paragraph1 ).children( input[type= checkbox  :checked] ).each(function() {         $(this).removeattr( checked ).attr( disabled  disabled );          }); }); </code></pre>   this code isn t working right b/c its only working half the time for some reason in ie8. also using find is not working right either maybe b/c a paragraph is not a good parent.,jquery
